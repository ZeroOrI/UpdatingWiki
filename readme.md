#### Basic A

> In the end, even after I entered this school. Nothing had changed. No, perhaps it was that I had no intention of changing anything from the start. For better or for worse, it was the same as that time. The reason for that was very simple. ... Because I myself wanted this. "

Kei Karuizawa (軽かる井い沢ざわ 恵けい, Karuizawa Kei) is a student of Class 2-D. She sits in the second row, the second seat from the left, next to Yōsuke Hirata, the class's representative.

[Return to content](#content)

#### Background A
She is a prominent figure of class. Being gifted with an attractive personality, she is considered to be the girl's leader of class D. Her development in the story is worth reading. Despite her looks and attitude she displays and the relationship between her and Hirata, she has her bunch of secrets that she cannot afford to reveal to others.

#### Appearance A
Kei is a teenage girl of average height with waist-length blonde hair that is tied in a ponytail and purple eyes. Her school uniform consists of a light blue dress shirt below the red school blazer with rolled-up sleeves and a short white skirt. She walks in standard school shoes with light blue calf-length socks. She predominantly wears a blue ribbon around her collar. In a more casual situation, she simply wraps her school blazer around her waist and rolls up her dress shirt sleeves.

[Return to content](#content)

#### Personality A
Kei is an outgoing person who spends most of her time with the girls at school and Yōsuke Hirata (her boyfriend). Typically she speaks for the girls in the class, acting as one of the leaders along with Yōsuke and eventually Suzune Horikita.

She seems to be a bit of a mooch, as after spending all her points from the first month and D-Class not receiving any, due to their penalties, she asked the girls of her class to lend her some money to buy the 'essentials', managing to gain at least 2000 points from Kikyō Kushida.

She doesn't take notice of less prominent people in the class. This was seen when she mentioned Kiyotaka Ayanokōji being "invisible" after Suzune nominated him as a guard with Yōsuke. Ironically, she befriended him in the light novels and they were very close, even being impressed by his abilities and going on a first name basis as she eventually starts to develop romantic feelings for him.

__Spoilers__ 

In volume 4 of the LN's, it was revealed that in her earlier years Kei was bullied in school, resulting in a physical scar and a lingering mental scar. To help prevent this happening again at her new high school, she started going out with Yōsuke Hirata, the most popular guy in class. This gave her a sense of security to just be herself without worrying about being targeted for abuse. Although this wasn't a genuine relationship, Yōsuke did know about the circumstances and went along with it to protect Kei.

#### Abilities A
Kei was assessed as being subpar by the school. Her absences and grades in middle school were direct reasons for her being placed in D-Class. She doesn't like academics nor sports but is surprisingly able to compete with others. She has immense mental strength, according to both Kiyotaka and Kakeru.

#### Plot A
In the anime, Kei, like the other first years, listened to the speech given by Manabu Horikita, welcoming the first years to their new school. She was seen in the class talking to Satsuki Shinohara before Yōsuke Hirata asked the class to introduce themselves, agreeing with the idea. [1](#original-1)

After the teacher Sae Chabashira walked in and introduced to the class the system in which they are supposed to live in now, Kei was surprised at the fact that they received 100,000 private points, to begin with. She was seen talking with Maya Satō and Chiaki Matsushita about clothes and jewelry shopping after the classes that day. At the start of the new month of June, along with the rest of D-Class, Kei was shocked when Class D did not receive the monthly allotment of points, looking depressed throughout the explanation of S-Points and the reason D-Class didn't get any points. [1](#original-1)

At some point later, Kei went to the pool with the rest of the class, getting especially close to Yōsuke, which possibly indicates that they have been dating since. She tried asking Kikyō to lend her points along with some other girls of the class to buy herself the 'essentials', in which at least Kikyō complied with the demand. She is seen getting closer to Yōsuke, then proceeding to take the mid-test exams and passing with an overall score of 75. [2](#original-2)

During the anime pool filler episode, Kei saw Suzune walking out of the apartment building, claiming how there were rumors she had died, since no one had seen her over the summer break. Kei then left, dragging Yōsuke with her after Suzune expressed her disinterest in hanging out with the rest of her class when being questioned about it. [3](#original-3)

Later Kei, like all the other first years, took part in the school cruise, where she was seen calling Yōsuke over to hang out with her friends.[4](#original-4) When the cruise ship headed to an island, all first-year students were told they need to survive for more than a week with basic materials. Kei got into an argument with Teruhiko Yukimura about the hygienic materials they would need for survival, specifically the need for a toilet. Kanji Ike joined the argument as well, but after setting up camp, he surprised Kei, as he apologized for his words since he went through a similar event when camping as a child. Touched by this, Kei apologized for not understanding his reasons as well.  [5](#original-5)

Towards the end of the survival test week, Kei was found crying in the girl's tent as her underwear was apparently stolen. The girls of her class had Yōsuke check all the boys and their luggage to find it. After minutes of searching, Yōsuke then found the underwear in Kiyotaka Ayanokōji's luggage but refrained from telling anyone, since he (rightfully) suspected that Ayanokōji was set up by someone else. [6](#original-6)

The next day, Kei and the other girls told the boys to build a separate camp from them because of the incident the day before. Kei had Yōsuke watch over the boys in the class while they moved, but Suzune requested that another boy should check over Yōsuke, since he could potentially be a threat as well. Though Kei defended her boyfriend, she agreed to the request but wondered which boy should help as all the other boys are deemed untrustworthy. Suzune then proposed that Kiyotaka be the second guard since he doesn't seem to have a lecherous side.

Kei recalled that Kiyotaka was often 'invisible' during class, admitting to herself that she barely noticed him being their classmate. In the same night, somebody had started a fire at camp by burning the survival test manual, Kei and the other girls questioned the culprit's identity, first suspecting that one of the boys must have done it. They soon, however, suspected Mio Ibuki because of she was nowhere to be found during the incident. They later learned that Suzune had dropped out of the test because of a fever. They then discussed Mio's motive and whether or not she was the actual culprit and C-Class' leader since her class had dropped out of the test earlier in the week. [7](#original-7)

The next morning, Kei was seen cleaning in the camp along with the girls. At the time of the class points announcement, she and the entire class were shocked to hear that D-Class came in the first place. Later that same day on the cruise ship, Kei and the others thanked Suzune for her brilliant plan, though, unbeknown to them that Kiyotaka actually planned everything but gave Suzune all the credit to boost her popularity in the class cementing her place as a dependable leader. [8](#original-8)

__Spoilers__
In the light novel, there was another exam on the ship after their return from the survival island. In this exam, their objective was to find a traitor hidden among the groups that were divided into 12 different groups based on the Chinese zodiac's names among all classes. Kei was put into the same group as Kiyotaka, Teruhiko Yukimura, Hideo Sotomura, and students from other classes such as Honami Ichinose from B-Class, Machida from A-Class, and Mio Ibuki and Shiho Manabe from C-Class. Kei couldn't hide her dissatisfaction when seeing Kiyotaka and others as her groupmates. [9](#original)

Kei was seen not taking part in the group discussions to expose the traitor, but she was often seen flirting with the handsome Machida from the A-Class, which eventually pissed off Manabe and her C class friends. Machida seems to taken interest in Kei due to her cuteness and he had shown a protective behavior toward Kei. Manabe and her friends then brought up the topic of how Kei shoved one of her friends, Rika, and asked for her apology. Kei then feigned ignorance and kept using Machida as a shield, which further pissed Manabe off.

After one of their group meetings, Kiyotaka and Teruhiko saw Kei getting dragged into the emergency stairs and getting confronted by Manabe and others. Manabe was still confronting Kei about the incident that happened to Rika, but Kei was being stubborn and neglected the fact that she pushed Rika. As the argument got heated up, Manabe and others lost their patience and started making physical contact with Kei. Though they began by shoving her shoulder, even this caused Kei to show strange symptoms for her, breathing raggedly and curling into a fetal position. Manabe and her friends then proceeded to grab Kei's hair and forcefully pulled Kei up, and saying that they wanted to hit Kei's face. This act of physical bullying really caused Kei to lose her previous arrogance and attitude, causing her to begin to shake and tear up to the point where the previous Karuizawa Kei seemed nothing more than a façade. Before the situation could turn even worse, Teruhiko, who couldn’t bear to watch it anymore, came to interrupt them. The situation did not get better until Kiyotaka said that he saw a teacher and said it was better for them to leave. Manabe and others left, and Kei recovered. She then brushed off Teruhiko, who showed concerns, and told him and Kiyotaka not to let anyone know about this.

Kiyotaka thought that Kei's reactions were too extreme, so he asked Hirata and learned about that Kei had been bullied since elementary school. As he learned that Kei was a capable person who could cover up her past using a new persona up until now, he decided to make her his pawn who would secretly completely obey his orders. He anonymously testified to Manabe about their issue, then used Hirata's phone to lure Kei to the ship's basement near the engine room and let Manabe's group get revenge for their friend. After Manabe's group left, he approached Kei and told her that he would save her in exchange for her obeying all orders. Kei tried to put up a strong front, but lost all will to resist when Kiyotaka glared deeply into her eye. He secretly took a video of Manabe bullying Kei at the staircase, which he used to save Kei by blackmailing Manabe's group into not approaching Kei or saying anything about Kei. Finally forming a relationship with Kei, he firstly made her go along with his plan, making A-class wrongly guess the group traitor.

### Relationships A

[Go to changes](#relationships-b)

[Return to content](#content)

#### Yosuke Hirata A
She seems to have a close relationship with Yōsuke as when the school first started she cheered on his idea of the class introducing themselves.

After several days of school, they seem to have formed a bond as they are often seen together. In truth, they're just pretending to be in a relationship in order for Kei to not get bullied in school so it is unknown how they really feel about each other.

__Spoilers__

In the light novel of Volume 4, despite being promised to protect Karuizawa from being bullied by Manabe and her group, Yōsuke doesn't want to take a side and want to discuss it peacefully without using violence against someone. He did offer his help to her, but since he's not her real boyfriend, he didn't need to go that far for her. He also tells her that he won't help her like this and she won't be able to depend on him if there's nothing he can do for her.[1](#reference-1)

__Yosuke's side__

Yōsuke seems to have close a relationship with Kei as when school first started, she cheered on his idea of the class introducing themselves. After several days of school, they seem to have become a couple or at least formed a bond as they are often seen together.

In truth, they're just pretending to be in a relationship so that Kei would not get bullied in school so it is unknown how they really feel about each other. However, it shown he does care for her as when Kei's underwear is stolen, Yōsuke searches the boys for them though he covers for Kiyotaka after finding them on him; he asks for the panties as he will suffer less being Kei's "boyfriend".

In return, she seems to trust him as she selected him to be part of the guards for the boys after the girls demanded the boys being separated from the girls. This was seen again as she defended him when Suzune hinted that he could possibly do mischievous activities while acting as a guard. However, she did see Suzune's point and went along with the latter's decision to make Kiyotaka a guard as well to keep an eye on Yōsuke.

In the light novel of Volume 4, despite being promised to protect Karuizawa from being bullied by Manabe and her group, Yōsuke doesn't want to take a side and want to discuss it peacefully without using violence against someone. He did offer his help to her, but since he's not her real boyfriend, he didn't need to go that far for her.

#### Suzune Horikita A

They don't have much interaction but don't appear on good terms.

In episode 7, she was rather callous to her and told Yōsuke they should go.

During the survival test, after Yōsuke is chosen by Kei to watch over the boys in the class, Suzune steps in. She doesn't oppose Kei's request of watching the boys but requested another boy join him on guard duty since he needed to be watched as well. After Kei mentions there was no other boy who seemed trustworthy, Suzune selected Kiyotaka.

__Suzune's side__

#### Kiyotaka Ayanokoji A

During the survival test, when Yōsuke is chosen to watch over the boys in the class, Suzune requested Kiyotaka join him on guard duty since he needed to be watched as well. While he is picked, Kei notes on him being invisible to the rest of the class, showing that she barely acknowledges his presence in their time as classmates.

Due to his real thoughts, it is unknown what he really thinks of her.

__Spoilers__

Much like the anime, Kei initially did not think much of Kiyotaka. She often looked down on him for being an "unremarkable guy" and appeared disgusted by his presence when they were both placed in the "Rabbit" group during the summer special test, although she shared the same feelings about her other groupmates, Hideo and Teruhiko, so it wasn't personal.

After being saved from Manabe and her group during the cruise ship test, she starts to hold a dislike towards Kiyotaka, unable to look at him without an angry expression and was mad when Hirata arranged a meeting with her but brought Kiyotaka with him. After being bullied by Manabe and her group in an isolated ward, she was blackmailed by Kiyotaka and threatened her that he'll reveal her past to the school, but assured her that he'll protect her from being bullied in exchange for aiding him on his scheme. [1](#reference-1])

She was amazed at his true physical abilities at the sports festival after he raced Manabu Horikita and nearly won. [2](#reference-2) She seems to have formed a friendship with him which evolves into a close trusting bond with him, where Kiyotaka is shown to truly trust her more so than others, even more than Suzune and in volume 6 of the light novel, it seems that she develops a crush on Kiyotaka. Her crush on him was also hinted further in the light novel when she became jealous of Maya's flirtation with Kiyotaka. Kei is one of the people who refer Kiyotaka on the first-name basis. She was also the first person to celebrate his birthday, causing him to hesitate on deleting her text messages, which he usually does. He also learned of her birthday and decided to do the same for her. [3](#reference-3)

In Volume 7, even though she learned from Kakeru Ryūen that Kiyotaka betrayed her by using her from the very beginning, she still refused to betray Kiyotaka, calling him her hero, as she refused to tell Kakeru Ryūen that Kiyotaka is the true mastermind of Class D. However, she was surprised to see Kiyotaka beating up Ryūen's gang, and angrily attack Ryūen for threatening her. She was shaken by his abilities but hugged him as she was relieved that he came to her aid as he mentioned his promise to protect her.[4](#reference-4)

In her monologue in volume 7.5, she admits that she has fallen in love with him. [5](#reference-5)

In volume 11.5, Kei sees Kiyotaka and Hiyori Shiina going on a date and becomes jealous. She is also jealous that Kiyotaka has the same hobby as Hiyori.

In the epilogue of volume 11.5, Kiyotaka declares his love for her and she accepts.

__Kiyotaka's side__

During the survival test, when Suzune selected Kiyotaka to serve as a guard along with Yōsuke Hirata to watch over the boys in the class, she noted on him being invisible to the rest of the class. Kei agreed with Suzune as he didn't seem lecherous to her, which seem to indicate that she doesn't take too much notice of him.
Due to his monologue at the end of the anime, it is unknown what he thinks of her.

__Spoilers__

In the light novels, their relationship is much more complex than it is in the anime.

Much like the anime, Kei initially did not think much of Kiyotaka. She often looked down on him for being an "unremarkable guy" despite not having anything personal against him. After he and Yukimura overhear Manabe and her group bullying her, she starts to hold a dislike towards him, unable to look at him without an angry expression and was mad when Hirata arranged a meeting with her but brought Kiyotaka with him.

It was soon discovered from Hirata that her condescending attitude is a facade she maintains to hide her true self. He explains that Kei has been a victim of bullying for the past nine years since she was little and also revealed about the fake relationship between her and Hirata. After learning about Kei's past, he set up Manabe and her group to bully Kei in an isolated ward,then he blackmailed her,but promised that he'll protect her from being bullied in exchange for aiding him in his schemes.

Afterwards, he seemed to form a very close trusting bond with her, where Kiyotaka is shown to trust her more so than others, even more than Suzune. In volume 6 of the light novel, it appears that she has developed a crush on Kiyotaka. Her crush on him was hinted further in the light novel when she became jealous of Maya's flirtations with Kiyotaka. Kei is one of the few people who refer to Kiyotaka by his first name. She was also the first person to celebrate his birthday, causing him to hesitate on deleting her text messages, which he usually does. He also learned of her birthday and decided to do the same for her.

In Volume 7, Kiyotaka decided to cut ties with Kei after he lost a reason to reach A-Class after he turned out to hold no control over him. In spite of this, Kiyotaka soon changed his mind and considered Kei as an efficient and valuable pawn after saving her, but in truth, her usefulness or not is a secondary concern for him as all that's important to him is that she remained to be his.

Despite this view of her, he appears to genuinely care for her as he protected her by violently attacking Kakeru and defeated him with ease through sheer strength and intense fear for threatening her. His actions surprised Kei as she watched him easily take down C-Class. She was shaken by his true abilities but hugged him as she was relieved that he came to her aid as he mentioned his promise to protect her.

In volume 11.5, Kei sees Kiyotaka and Hiyori Shiina going on a date and becomes jealous. She is also jealous that Kiyotaka has the same hobby as Hiyori.

In the epilogue of volume 11.5, Kiyotaka declares his love for her and she accepts.

> ~~In the end, even after I entered this school. Nothing had changed. No, perhaps it was that I had no intention of changing anything from the start. For better or for worse, it was the same as that time. The reason for that was very simple. ... Because I myself wanted this.~~

She doesn't ~~take notic of~~**care about** less prominent people in the class. This was seen when she mentioned Kiyotaka Ayanokōji being ~~invisible"~~ **gloomy, lecherous wallflower**[5.78](#5.78change) after Suzune nominated him as a guard with Yōsuke. ~~Ironically, she befriended him in the light novels and they were very close, even being impressed by his abilities and going on a first name basis as she eventually starts to develop romantic feelings for him.~~ [6](#6change).

__Spoilers__ 

In volume 4 of the LN's, it was revealed that in her earlier years Kei was bullied in school, resulting in a physical scar and a lingering mental scar. To help prevent this happening again at her new high school, she started going out with Yōsuke Hirata, the most popular guy in class. __Even if she was scared that Hirata could betray her, she didn't have a choice and tried this.__  This gave her a sense of security to just be herself without worrying about being targeted for abuse. Although this wasn't a genuine relationship, Yōsuke did know about the circumstances and went along with it to protect Kei.

#### Plot B

~~**PLOT**~~
**Anime**

In the anime, Kei, like the other first years, listened to the speech given by Manabu Horikita, welcoming the first years to their new school. She was seen in the class talking to Satsuki Shinohara before Yōsuke Hirata asked the class to introduce themselves, agreeing with the idea.

After the teacher Sae Chabashira walked in and introduced to the class the system in which they are supposed to live in now, Kei was surprised at the fact that they received 100,000 private points, to begin with. She was seen talking with Maya Satō and Chiaki Matsushita about clothes and jewelry shopping after the classes that day. At the start of the new month of June, along with the rest of D-Class, Kei was shocked when Class D did not receive the monthly allotment of points, looking depressed throughout the explanation of S-Points and the reason D-Class didn't get any points.

At some point later, Kei went to the pool with the rest of the class, getting especially close to Yōsuke, which possibly indicates that they have been dating since. She tried asking Kikyō to lend her points along with some other girls of the class to buy herself the 'essentials', in which at least Kikyō complied with the demand. She is seen getting closer to Yōsuke, then proceeding to take the mid-test exams and passing with an overall score of 75.

During the anime pool filler episode, Kei saw Suzune walking out of the apartment building, claiming how there were rumors she had died, since no one had seen her over the summer break. Kei then left, dragging Yōsuke with her after Suzune expressed her disinterest in hanging out with the rest of her class when being questioned about it.

Later Kei, like all the other first years, took part in the school cruise, where she was seen calling Yōsuke over to hang out with her friends. When the cruise ship headed to an island, all first-year students were told they need to survive for more than a week with basic materials. Kei got into an argument with Teruhiko Yukimura about the hygienic materials they would need for survival, specifically the need for a toilet. Kanji Ike joined the argument as well, but after setting up camp, he surprised Kei, as he apologized for his words since he went through a similar event when camping as a child. Touched by this, Kei apologized for not understanding his reasons as well.

Towards the end of the survival test week, Kei was found crying in the girl's tent as her underwear was apparently stolen. The girls of her class had Yōsuke check all the boys and their luggage to find it. After minutes of searching, Yōsuke then found the underwear in Kiyotaka Ayanokōji's luggage but refrained from telling anyone.~~since he (rightfully) suspected that Ayanokōji was set up by someone else.~~ [8](#8change)

The next day, Kei and the other girls told the boys to build a separate camp from them because of the incident the day before. Kei had Yōsuke watch over the boys in the class while they moved, but Suzune requested that another boy should check over Yōsuke, since he could potentially be a threat as well. Though Kei defended her boyfriend, she agreed to the request but wondered which boy should help as all the other boys are deemed untrustworthy. Suzune then proposed that Kiyotaka be the second guard since he doesn't seem to have a lecherous side.

Kei recalled that Kiyotaka was often 'invisible' during class, admitting to herself that she barely noticed him being their classmate. In the same night, somebody had started a fire at camp by burning the survival test manual, Kei and the other girls questioned the culprit's identity, first suspecting that one of the boys must have done it. They soon, however, suspected Mio Ibuki because of she was nowhere to be found during the incident. They later learned that Suzune had dropped out of the test because of a fever. They then discussed Mio's motive and whether or not she was the actual culprit and C-Class' leader since her class had dropped out of the test earlier in the week.

The next morning, Kei was seen cleaning in the camp along with the girls. At the time of the class points announcement, she and the entire class were shocked to hear that D-Class came in the first place. Later that same day on the cruise ship, Kei and the others thanked Suzune for her brilliant plan, though, unbeknown to them that Kiyotaka actually planned everything but gave Suzune all the credit to boost her popularity in the class cementing her place as a dependable leader.


```==================================```

**LN Plot**

**Anime adapted first 3 volumes of light novel and pool episode from volume 4.5. But scenes related to Kei was cut off or changed drasically.**

**Kei Karuizawa apparently begins to date Yōsuke Hirata according to rumors that are spreading among the students.**

**After school is out for one day, The Idiot Trio invites Kiyotaka to go out with them for the evening, including that Kikyō would also be coming. She shows up and admits that she had invited Yōsuke Hirata, Kei Karuizawa, Nene Mori, and Chiaki Matsushita to join them after they accendenlty meet each over. The awkward group leaves to go look around campus. While they were hanging around the mall, Kei spent 30.000 points on different clothes. They talk a bit about relationships until the group's conversation turns into one about the monthly point balances. As everyone expresses their opinions about the school's point balances, Kei said that 100.000 points isn't enough for her.**[9.5] [#9.5change]

**After spending all her points from the first month and D-Class not receiving any, due to their penalties, she asked the girls of her class to lend her some money to buy the 'essentials', managing to gain at least 2000 points from Kikyō Kushida and other girls from her class.**

**When Chabashira announces to the class that Sudō had gotten in a fight a few days earlier with C-Class students and that the two sides had given conflicting reports of what happened. Many of the students from Class 1-D begin to voice their frustration for Sudō and his attitude. Although students voice their dissatisfaction, Yōsuke Hirata and Kei Karuizawa back her up and the atmosphere in the class changes into one motivated to prove Sudō innocent.** [10](#4.75change)

**After school, two groups of students were formed in order to search for the potential witness to the event, with Hirata and Karuizawa leading one group and Kushida leading the other.** [11](#12change)

**The first-year students of the Advanced Nurturing High School went on a luxurious liner for a 2-week cruise trip prepared by the school, after the end-of-term exam. Kei and her friend in particular were enjoying the atmosphere and sceneries.** [12](#13change)

**Arrived on island Yōsuke Hirata lists and discusses the needs of camping spots and necessities. The girls and boys sides, particularly Shinohara and Ike, start arguing again about the toilet matter. Since a temporary one costs 20 points, the boys want to use just the cardboard ones to preserve their points as much as possible and only spend them when necessary, while the girls object to the idea. When girls asked opinion of Kei, she said that they should save as many points as possible, even if they have to use cardbox toilet** [13](#11change)

**Towards the end of the survival test week, Kei was found crying in the girl's tent as her underwear was apparently stolen. The girls of her class had Yōsuke check all the boys and their luggage to find it.**

**While sleeping, the boys suddenly get waken up by the girls, who appear upset. Shinohara informs that Karuizawa's underwear has been stolen. As their luggage was put outside the tents to make space, Shinohara believes someone has gone through them and taken it. Karuizawa is in tears and being comforted by other girls in the tent, while the boys become alerted of the situation.**

**The girls request to live separately from the boys as they still believe the culprit is among them. D-Class's unity start falling apart as both sides have a huge argument about it. The girls, lead by Karuizawa and Shinohara, ask Hirata for help as they can trust him, but Suzune opposes against it. Suzune explains her reasoning and wants another boy, in this case Kiyotaka, to watch over Hirata. The girls cast their doubts on him, they think that he acted too suspicious, but Airi tries to defend him. Karuizawa lashes out at Airi and starts teasing her, with other girls joining in. Unable to bear it, Airi runs off into the forest.** [14](#14change)

**After further explanations from Suzune, Karuizawa agrees to let Kiyotaka be on guard as he seems to be the most harmless and Hirata is fine with it. Trying to calm both parties, Hirata voices his thoughts over the matter, stating that he does not want the class to doubt their own classmates. Someone then mentions Ibuki as a possible suspect but Shinohara and Karuizawa still keep their suspicions on the boys.**

**Unlike the boys’ tent, which was Spartan-like in its lack of comfort, the girls’ tent was completely different. It was spacious, with a floor mat on the ground so that they wouldn’t have to sleep on the hard earth. There were several pillows inflated with air. On top of that was a battery-powered cordless fan. Girls hadn’t sacrificed anything from the very start. They’d simply bought whatever they needed. It was Karuizawa-san and the others asked for these. Apparently, they’d secretly indulged themselves quite well.**  [15](#15change)

**When D-Class returns to the ship, they met Suzune, that still looking pale, and the students gather around her.  Karuizawa apologises for what she said, stating that Ibuki was the underwear theft and Kiyotaka has told them everything. She says that Suzune had tried to chase after Ibuki, and she also found out C-Class and A-Class leaders and told Hirata about it.**

__Spoilers__

**Before next exam starts Kei gives a monologue reflecting on how nothing has changed since she entered the school. From the beginning, she had no intention of changing anything, as she simply understands herself more than anyone else, both in strengths and weaknesses. Even when no one likes her she still doesn't want to change, because she had wanted this. Looking at herself in the mirror after getting out of the bathroom, she suddenly feels dizzy and throws up. She keeps asking herself on the reason for her sufferings, without being able to change anything from the past. As such, she will do anything to protect herself, to ensure that will never happen again. She declares herself a 'parasite', a weak creature incapable of surviving on its own.** [16](#16change)

**After returning on the ship, Hirata and Kiyotaka were relaxing at their room. Hirata tells Kiyotaka about his plan on having lunch with Karuizawa and invites him to tag along. Kiyotaka denies, stating he would probably not get along with Karuizawa's group. Hirata insists on inviting him and asks whether it would be fine if there's only two of them. Kiyotaka says Karuizawa may not be happy with it as an attempt to decline, but Hirata reassures him, saying that he has limited opportunities to eat together with him while he can eat with Karuizawa whenever he wants. Kiyotaka doesn't have a choice and and agrees to his suggestion.** 

**Hirata wants to find a way for getting help from Suzune but before two of them can come to some conclusion, Karuizawa approaches them and calls out to Hirata. While Hirata tries telling her about their cancelled lunch, Karuizawa and her friends join in and quickly push Kiyotaka out of the group.** [17](#17change)

**At 18:00, Karuizawa enters and sits down. There is Mashima, Class A's homeroom teacher, along with three of his classmates, Hideo Sotomura and Teruhiko Yukimura, and Kiyotaka Ayanokoji, and one empty seat. She wonders why her classmates are also there but gets reprimanded by Mashima for being late.

**Mashima then explains the contents of the new special exam. The four of them will also be in the same group and they may be joined in by some other students, who are also receiving the same explanations in other rooms. Karuizawa berates that she has to be in the same room as the three boys and prefers to be with Hirata. Unable to stay silent, Kei reflexively spoke up with one question after another.  Yukimura loses his patience and starts arguing with her, but Kiyotaka quickly intervenes. Mashima briefly scolds them and tells them to get along, but Karuizawa refuses and expresses her disgust. Karuizawa then asks Mashima on why only the four of them are getting this explanation, with Mashima explaining that there's a risk of confusing the students if the exam itself is not explained like this in advance, since there isn't just one class being divided but 3 to 5 people from each class being divided into groups.** 


~~There was another exam on the ship after their return from the survival island. In this exam, their objective was to find a traitor hidden among the groups that were divided into 12 different groups based on the Chinese zodiac's names among all classes. Kei was put into the same group as Kiyotaka, Teruhiko Yukimura, Hideo Sotomura,~~ __Beside her classmates she was put in group__ ~~and~~ of students from other classes such as Honami Ichinose from B-Class, Machida from A-Class, and Mio Ibuki and Shiho Manabe from C-Class. ~~Kei couldn't hide her dissatisfaction when seeing Kiyotaka and others as her groupmates.~~ **Kei couldn't hide her dissatisfaction when seeing Mio Ibuki as her groupmates.** [18](#18change) 

**After Mashima finisged explanation the group of four are then told to leave but Yukimura suggests staying and having a chat as they're now in the same group for the exam. Karuizawa ignores his words and starts walking away while calling Hirata.** [19](#19changes)

**When special exam started Karuizawa and Ibuki both sat a little further away, as if isolating themselves, both of them didn't tried to confront each-other after underwear accident on island.** [20](#20change)

**Karuizawa didn’t understand, but with just one simple question, a hierarchy formed within the group, and she was on top.** [21](#21change)
**Even if Kei at start agreed on coorperation and on outcome number 1, but after suggestion from Machida that they doesn't have to discuss anything, she suddenly changed her opinion saying that she wanted to end this exam as soon as possible.** [22](#22change)
~~Kei was seen not taking part in the group discussions to expose the traitor, but she was often seen flirting with the handsome Machida from the A-Class, which eventually pissed off Manabe and her C class friends. Machida seems to taken interest in Kei due to her cuteness and he had shown a protective behavior toward Kei. Manabe and her friends then brought up the topic of how Kei shoved one of her friends, Rika, and asked for her apology. Kei then feigned ignorance and kept using Machida as a shield, which further pissed Manabe off.~~ [23](#23change)
**After discussion can't be continued  Manabe from Class C calls out to Karuizawa, asking about her encounter with Rika Morifuji, another Class C student. Manabe claims that Karuizawa has pushed Rika out of the line at a cafe, then asks Karuizawa to go and apologise to Rika. Karuizawa denies and claims she doesn't know anything, but retorts when Manabe tries to take a picture of her to confirm with Rika. During their confrontation Ibuki expresses his displeasure about actions of Manabe. As Manabe becomes more suspicious, Karuizawa turns to Machida for help, who tells Manabe to stop forcibly taking photos of Karuizawa and that it would be better to talk with Rika to confirm the story. Manabe eventually withdraws.** [24](#24change)

**Situation gets worse when after meeting is over exhausted Kei accidentely steps on Manabe's foot. Even when Kei appologized, Manabe didn't accept it and only shouted at her.** [25](#25change)

**At second meeting becomes obvious that Karuizawa's current behaviour is very stange. She doesn't act as usual self. And the reason for that she is no more at the top of hierarchy.** [26](#26change)

**Kiyotaka realises that she has been acting differently than usual. He wants to know more about her vulnerable side and decides to act. Kiyotaka then chases after Manabe and her friends in Class C. He calls out to them when they reach the elevator and mentions Karuizawa. This grabs their attention and Kiyotaka lies that he saw Karuizawa pushed over their friend at the cafe and wants to give them a heads up.** [27](#27change)

**Kiyotaka becomes more and more curious about Karuizawa, and he dicides to talk about her with Suzune. He wonders about Kei's secret self. But due to intervention from Ibuki their discussion Kiyotaka couldn't get any useful information.** [28](#28change) **Later at the same day Kiyotaka learns from Yukimura that Kei is not VIP, but she didn't prove this by showing text of message.** [28.5](#28.5change)

**When there is time for 3rd meeting the first person who came was Kei. She wanted to avoid contact with Manabe and other girls. Next person who came after her was Ayanokoji. Before he could even start a converstation she's already talked on phone with her female friend from another group totally ignoring him. The topic of their conversation was her complaints about that she didn't get in same group as Hirata and others. This talk was for scouting in advance to control them, in order to avoid issues from appearing after the test was finished.** [29](#29change)

**Because she still had time before 18:00, in order to pass the time she asked him a question. But due to Kiyotaka's poor communicative abilities they couldn't have a normal conversation.** [30](#30change)

**As all the members have shown up, Class A take their distance as usual. Karuizawa stands up and joins them, sitting next to Machida, who then assures to help her if anything happens.** [31](#31change)

**The next group meeting, before the discussion time starts, the Class C girls ask Machida to come play with them after the meeting. Karuizawa then arrives and tells them to give back her seat. Manabe provokes Karuizawa by saying she is talking to Machida and tell him to choose. Karuizawa grabs Machida's hand and tells him that she won't go out with him if he chooses Manabe. Kiyotaka is surprised that she can say that while being Hirata's girlfriend. Machida then asks Manabe to move, leaving her annoyed. Kiyotaka notes that Karuizawa has been attaching herself to Hirata and Machida, so that she can gain control and influence within her class and the group. Kiyotaka wonders about the reason for her actions, whether it is for a sense of superiority, self-satisfaction or the spotlight.** [32](#32change)

**Karuizawa, after exchanging contact information with Machida, exits the room. The Class C girls, Manabe and her two friends, then make their way out. Yukimura points out a weird vibe from the three. While Sotomura can't notice anything, Kiyotaka thinks he is correct. Yukimura and Kiyotaka see them following Karuizawa, who is now alone by herself, and quietly chase after them.** [33](#33change)

**Kiyotaka hears a sound of the door leading to the emergency stairs slamming shut. He quietly opens it and hears the three girls confronting Karuizawa. Karuizawa still feigns ignorance when being asked about their friend, Rika. However, she quickly tells them that she accidentally bumped into Rika when the girls try to call her, but refuses to apologise and says that their friend is in the wrong.**

**Losing their patience, the three girls begin to use physical threats on Karuizawa. Yukimura tries to open the door but Kiyotaka stops him. As Karuizawa starts having trouble breathing and holding her head, Manabe then grabs her hair and yanks her head up, threatening to cut up her face. Karuizawa is trembled and becomes unable to move.**

**Yukimura is unable to hold it and opens the door to intervene. Kiyotaka also steps in and tells the girls that a teacher has just passed by so they should better leave. The Class C girls then threaten Karuizawa for the last time before leaving.**

**Yukimura asks Karuizawa if she is okay, but she slaps his hand away and tells him to leave her alone. She then angrily leaves the place, slamming the door shut. Yukimura is overwhelmed and leaves after seemingly exhausted. Kiyotaka believes that there is another reason for Karuizawa's terrified appearance, other than being threatened.** [34](#34change)

~~After one of their group meetings, Kiyotaka and Teruhiko saw Kei getting dragged into the emergency stairs and getting confronted by Manabe and others. Manabe was still confronting Kei about the incident that happened to Rika, but Kei was being stubborn and neglected the fact that she pushed Rika. As the argument got heated up, Manabe and others lost their patience and started making physical contact with Kei. Though they began by shoving her shoulder, even this caused Kei to show strange symptoms for her, breathing raggedly and curling into a fetal position. Manabe and her friends then proceeded to grab Kei's hair and forcefully pulled Kei up, and saying that they wanted to hit Kei's face. This act of physical bullying really caused Kei to lose her previous arrogance and attitude, causing her to begin to shake and tear up to the point where the previous Karuizawa Kei seemed nothing more than a façade. Before the situation could turn even worse, Teruhiko, who couldn’t bear to watch it anymore, came to interrupt them. The situation did not get better until Kiyotaka said that he saw a teacher and said it was better for them to leave. Manabe and others left, and Kei recovered. She then brushed off Teruhiko, who showed concerns, and told him and Kiyotaka not to let anyone know about this.~~

~~Kiyotaka thought that Kei's reactions were too extreme, so he asked Hirata and learned about that Kei had been bullied since elementary school. As he learned that Kei was a capable person who could cover up her past using a new persona up until now, he decided to make her his pawn who would secretly completely obey his orders. He anonymously testified to Manabe about their issue, then used Hirata's phone to lure Kei to the ship's basement near the engine room and let Manabe's group get revenge for their friend. After Manabe's group left, he approached Kei and told her that he would save her in exchange for her obeying all orders. Kei tried to put up a strong front, but lost all will to resist when Kiyotaka glared deeply into her eye. He secretly took a video of Manabe bullying Kei at the staircase, which he used to save Kei by blackmailing Manabe's group into not approaching Kei or saying anything about Kei. Finally forming a relationship with Kei, he firstly made her go along with his plan, making A-class wrongly guess the group traitor.~~

**At 2:00 AM in the midnight, Karuizawa has contacted Hirata, she wanted to meet with him. The meeting is at a lounge area near the second floor. Karuizawa is surprised and angered that Kiyotaka is there, but Hirata tells her that he brings him along since he seems to understand the situation. Hirata then talks about Karuizawa's encounter with the Class C girls, with Kiyotaka confirming that he also saw it. Karuizawa has asked Hirata to take revenge on the girls, but Hirata refuses and wants to resolve things with them peacefully. Karuizawa insists that it's not possible, but Hirata replies that he can't just hurt someone else to help her. Karuizawa shouts that he's a liar since he said he would protect her. Hirata stands up and says that he's told her from the start, that they are not actually boyfriend and girlfriend and he won't fight a war for her.**

**Hirata tells her that he intends to speak with Manabe and her friends in the morning and will tell them that Karuizawa will apologise. Karuizawa still refuses and Hirata says he can't help her if that's the case. Hirata then asks Kiyotaka for ideas, but Karuizawa angrily declares that she doesn't need help and their relationship is over, before abandons them and leaves.**

**Kiyotaka asks about Hirata's fake relationship with Karuizawa, pointing out that they've been dating for almost 4 months but their relationship hadn't progressed much. Kiyotaka notes that Karuizawa's popularity had soared after going out with Hirata, and he was playing the boyfriend role to help raising her status.**

**Kiyotaka thinks that there's still more to it, as Hirata had easily accepted her request and she couldn't simply just use Machida to increase her influence. He then comes to the conclusion that she wanted to protect herself.**

**Hirata then reveals that Karuizawa was viciously bullied in elementary and junior high years and that she was just desperately trying to act tough and not showing her real personality.**

**Kiyotaka says he can't save both Karuizawa and Manabe. Hirata understands that and says it's probably the reason why Kiyotaka is also there with him at the moment. Hirata asks Kiyotaka and Suzune to keep this story confidential. Kiyotaka then asks Hirata for a favour and hands him a piece of paper. Hirata accepts his request and tells Kiyotaka that he knows the identity of the last VIP student from Class D.** [35](#35change)
 
**Kiyotaka then proceeds down to the lowest level on the ship, to an area prohibited from students but isn't locked, where generally no one appears and phones have almost no reception. After observing, Kiyotaka then returns to the upper deck and make a call to Hirata. He then receives a message from Hirata, saying he's promised to meet Karuizawa at 4:00 PM and sends Kiyotaka information about Manabe. Kiyotaka then starts messaging anonymously to Manabe. He tells her that he is a classmate who also hates Karuizawa and wants to work together to get a revenge on her. Manabe is initially suspicious but eventually follows and asks about the plan. Kiyotaka sends her the map of the ship's lowest level and says that he will call Karuizawa there so Manabe can settle things with her. Kiyotaka also has another plan prepared in case he failed to convince Manabe through chat, by blackmailing her with the pictures he took when she and her friends confronted Karuizawa at the emergency stairwell, but the risks were high and he wanted to avoid drawing attention as much as possible.**

**Karuizawa arrives early at the meeting point where she is supposed to meet Hirata. At 4 o'clock, Manabe and her friends also comes to the place, including Rika. Karuizawa notices them and starts trembling. Manabe tells Karuizawa to meet Rika and apologise to her. Karuizawa still insists that she didn't do anything wrong, but Manabe threatens her and tells her that she knew about Karuizawa being bullied (Kiyotaka has told Manabe in the chat that Karuizawa was bullied since childhood). Karuizawa weakly denies and tries to escape, but Manabe grabs her hair and slams her to the wall. Manabe then starts beating Karuizawa up, even pressing Rika to join in, while Karuizawa keeps pleading them to stop and collapses in fear. Kiyotaka quietly leaves the scene and closes the door.**

**After Manabe and her friends have left, Kiyotaka enters and calls Karuizawa, who is still cowering on the ground. As she didn't expected to be there, Karuizawa becomes panicked. After a while, Kiyotaka asks if she's calmed down. Karuizawa wipes her tears and asks about Hirata. Kiyotaka says he's there in his place, since a teacher called Hirata away and Kiyotaka just happened to be with him in that time. Karuizawa says that Manabe and her friends caused the scene and warns him not to tell anyone about it. She also suggests him to get back at them since they're girls. Kiyotaka refuses as it would only escalate the situation further. Karuizawa mutters that Manabe and her friends would continue doing awful things to her. Kiyotaka tells her he understands that she wants to prevent it, since it would be terrible if things went back like in the old days.**

**Karuizawa asks what he is talking about. Kiyotaka pins her against the wall and mentions how Manabe and her friends beat her up and the fact that she was a victim of bullying. Karuizawa asks if he heard it from Hirata, and Kiyotaka replies that he isn't of any use to her in a situation like this.**

**Kiyotaka then threatens to expose her if she doesn't do as he says. Karuizawa screams and asks if he's after her body. Kiyotaka runs his fingertips across her thighs. Karuizawa tries to escape but Kiyotaka threatens her not to run or he'll tell everyone in the school about her. Kiyotaka then tells her to spread her legs and pretends to play with his belt buckle. He is interested in how far she would go instead of her body and concludes that she has become a perfect tool for him.**

**Karuizawa vents her anger and mentions it's not the first time she's succumbed to forces. She gives a thin smile and stares at Kiyotaka, saying she couldn't do anything else and could only take all the bullying. As she lifts her skirt, Kiyotaka grabs her wrists and asks what happened to her. Karuizawa tells him about her punishments that happened countless times, with any kind of bullying one can imagine. Kiyotaka thinks she is still hiding something and presses on. Noticing her gaze at her left waist, he grabs her uniform and pulls it up, which reveals a deep scar caused by a sharp blade.**

**Kiyotaka sees the darkness in her eyes that overlaps with his and decides that he needs to release her from the shackles of her past. He promises to protect her from bullying from now on, claiming he is much more reliable than Hirata or Machida. He then shows her his phone that has a photo of her being assaulted by Manabe and her group, saying he can stop them with it. He wants her to cooperate and assist him in the future, doing whatever he needs. As Class D lacks unity, if she can control the girls, the situation will improve and they can be able to overtake Class A. He then tells her they first need to guide their group to victory in this exam. As Karuizawa wonders how, Kiyotaka says that she can help since she is the VIP student.** [36](#36change)

```
“Hey, excuse me? I object to this, too. You’re okay with sentencing the unathletic students to lose, like Shinohara said? You think we can all come together in a situation like this?”
Karuizawa spoke up, supporting Shinohara.
She glared at Horikita. 
“I’ve said as much. Do you understand my logic?” 
“No. I don’t get it at all. Hey, what do you think, Kushida-san?” asked Karuizawa.
Kushida had been strangely quiet during the meeting. She seemed slightly surprised, but spoke after a moment.
“It’s tough. I’ve been thinking about how both sides feel. Like Horikita-san, I want us to succeed as a
class. But, just like Shinohara-san said, everyone should have a chance to win. If there were some kind of middle-ground solution, that would be ideal. A strategy we could all get behind.” 
Once Kushida was done, there were a lot of noises of assent. 
Horikita seemed to have anticipated this idea.
“Of course. I have a compromise that should be agreeable to both sides. Students who place at the top, and don’t need to boost their test scores, will use the private points they win to boost the test scores of students who place at the bottom. The entire class will share in the gains and losses of private points from the festival. I trust there will be no complaints?” asked Horikita.
So, in exchange for lowering our chances of victory across the board, we less-athletic students would also offset the risks in case we were defeated.
The bottom ten students across each grade level would still be in trouble, though.
“Oh, yeah, that’d be fine,” said Sudou with a disdainful snort, as if he were calling the opposition pathetic whiners.
“But that’s just for points. We’re still losing out on chances to win the big prize. What does everyone think about that?” 
Karuizawa wasn’t letting this go. She looked over to her group of girls. 
“If Karuizawa-san objects, then so do I, I guess.” 
One after another, the girls followed her lead.
“You’re objecting just because she objected? That’s completely illogical. This is an exam. It’s only natural that we focus on a winning strategy. The other class definitely isn’t weighed down by morons like you,”grumbled Horikita. 
“You just don’t get it, do you, Horikita-san? I hate this plan, and the other girls hate it, too. So, you need to take our opinions into account. We have to make these competitions fair,” said Karuizawa.
“Calm down, both of you,” said Hirata.
“If we can’t agree, then we’ve got to have a majority vote.” 
This had probably been inevitable.
“I think we should vote,” continued Hirata. 
“If Yousuke-kun says so, then I agree,” said Karuizawa. 
“Fine. This isn’t the time to fight amongst ourselves. At any rate, I’ve offered my opinion. I hope you’ll all make the right decision,” said Horikita.
She sat down in frustration and glared at me.
“Ayanokouji-kun, can’t you tell Karuizawa-san to shut up?” she huffed. 
“Uh, no. There’s no way I could do that,” I said. 
“You’ve been talking to her lately, though. Haven’t you? Isn’t that why she’s getting carried away?”
“No. Karuizawa’s always been like that,” I replied.
“That’s certainly true,” Horikita muttered.
She couldn’t hide her irritation with Karuizawa, whose opinion lacked logic, or with the girls who let someone else lead them around.
“Now then,” said Hirata.
“We have Horikita’s proposal, which focuses on ability, and Karuizawa-san’s, which prioritizes the individual. How about we decide which plan we prefer by a show of hands? If anyone finds choosing a side difficult, they can abstain.”
Horikita wanted to win, while Karuizawa wanted everyone to feel valued. The class’s future would depend on whether people used their heads or their hearts.
Of course, I myself had zero interest in the outcome.
“All right. All those in favor of Horikita-san’s plan?” “Yeah. I agree with Horikita’s plan, of course,” said Sudou.
“It’s about winning. When winners win, we all win. Ain’t that a good thing?” Sudou raised his hand.
Those who had no confidence whatsoever in their athletic abilities, like Yukimura and Sakura, followed his lead.
But the more capable students, along with Karuizawa’s group, didn’t raise their hands. 
“Sixteen votes, then. Thank you. You can put your hands down.”
“Wait a minute, Ayanokouji-kun. Don’t tell me you agree with Karuizawa-san’s plan?” said Horikita, who realized that I hadn’t raised my hand.
“Relax. It’s my policy to abstain from voting.” 
“In that case, you could just have voted for my plan,” she growled. 
“Your plan isn’t necessarily right, is it?” I asked.
“I can’t understand you. Giving the class the best-possible chance of winning will ultimately result in netting a lot of private points. Even if we only won a few matches here and there, the points would be significant. If you say that’s wrong, perhaps you can give me a clear reason why?” 
“I didn’t say you were wrong. I’m just saying it’s not the only answer,” I replied.

The students used as sacrificial lambs, sent out to be destroyed by strong opponents, would finish the sports festival without earning any points at all. 
Horikita did understand that much, at least. But she also thought it was a necessary sacrifice in order to win.
“The other students aren’t all as ambitious as you,” I told her.
“All right. Next, we have Karuizawa-san’s plan. Anyone in favor of this plan, to win when we need to and have fun when we want to, please raise your hand,” said Hirata.
Along with Karuizawa’s group, other students began raising their hands.
“And the results of the majority vote are…sixteen votes for Horikitasan’s plan, and thirteen votes for Karuizawa-san’s. 
It’s safe to say that everyone else abstained from voting?”

“Um… I don’t think that A-Ayanokouji-kun would do such a thing…” 
I’d thought that all the girls doubted me and no one would back me, but someone rather unexpected spoke up for me. Sakura, cowering behind everyone with her back arched, fidgeted bashfully while she spoke out in my favor. I couldn’t have imagined a girl who disliked being noticed more than anything doing such a bold thing.
“Huh? What do you mean? Why would you say that?” answered Karuizawa, seemingly upset about Sakura speaking out.
The sheepish, nervous Sakura was an easy target for such a popular girl. Sakura was definitely easier to confront than Horikita. In an instant, Karuizawa changed her target, lashing out at Sakura with her words as if sinking her teeth into prey. 
“Huh? Why? How do you know that? How do you know Ayanokoujikun isn’t the culprit?”
“Well…that’s because…he isn’t that kind of person.” Sakura was backed into a corner, and barely managed to squeak out her fearful answer.
“Huh? I don’t understand what you mean. That’s not an answer.” Karuizawa folded her arms and laughed mockingly at Sakura.
“Oh? Could it be that Sakura-san likes someone plain and invisible like Ayanokoujikun?” Rather than saying it contemptuously, Karuizawa said it as though it were reasonable to assume.
It would’ve been fine if Sakura had just shrugged off such remarks, but she took them on.
“Y-you’re wrong!” Sakura stumbled back in a panic, her face completely red.
“Whoa! That’s such an obvious reaction. It’s like what an elementary-schooler would do!” 
The other girls joined Karuizawa in laughing out loud.
“That’s…! W-well… Ah!” “Heh, isn’t that a good thing, though? You like him, and no one else does, right? Hey, will you confess to him here? I’ll even help you out!”
“Ah!”

Unlike the boys’ tent, which was Spartan-like in its lack of comfort, the girls’ tent was completely different.
It was spacious, with a floor mat on the ground so that they wouldn’t have to sleep on the hard earth. 
There were several pillows inflated with air. On top of that was a battery-powered cordless fan.
“The tent on the other side has the exact same things in it, too. A total of twelve points.” 
“I thought the girls were putting up with the heat unusually well. So this is how you’re getting through it.” They hadn’t sacrificed anything from the very start. They’d simply bought whatever they needed.
“Karuizawa-san and the others asked for these.” Apparently, they’d secretly indulged themselves quite well.

“I only found out after they’d already ordered everything. It’s difficult to do anything when the rules say anyone may buy an item and spend points.”
Just like how Kouenji had withdrawn so early in the test. 
“Karuizawa-san reported this to Hirata-kun, so he definitely knew about it. But you didn’t know, nor did he inform anyone else. I think he absolutely should have shared this information.” Horikita had her arms crossed.
She did have a point, but I doubted Hirata had stayed quiet out of malice. Maybe he’d just wanted to avoid unnecessary confusion? If Karuizawa had reported properly to Hirata, then the amount could have been evaluated.
“I understand what you mean, but there’s nothing I can really say about it. We can’t get spent points back, and there aren’t many days left before the test ends. Karuizawa and the others probably won’t spend any more points,” I said.

In the end, nothing changed even after I came to this school. No, that’s wrong… Maybe I never had any intention of changing. 
For better or worse, it’s always been the same for me. After all, I understand myself better than anyone else.
I know everything about myself, including my strengths and weaknesses. I know that none of the boys or girls like me.
Even knowing that, I’ve never thought to change. But it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t hurt me anymore.
Because for some reason, I want them to feel that way. 
As I got out of the shower, I stood and looked at myself in the mirror —completely naked, drops of water trickling down my skin.
How many times had I thought about smashing the mirror to pieces? 
Every time I saw that old wound on my side, it was like diving back into my disgusting past. 
Dizzy and nauseated, I gripped the sink and vomited. Why did I have to have to go through such an awful experience? 
Why do I have to suffer like this? Why, why, why? I’ve asked that question for a long time now. Words don’t mean anything. 
The past can’t change. No one can change it. God is cruel. My life was destroyed because of that nightmarish day. 
I lost my youth, my friends, and even myself. I have to fix that mistake. No matter how much people hate me, it’ll be better than suffering like that again.
I don’t need youth. I don’t need friends. The most important thing is protecting myself. I’ll do whatever it takes.
I’m a parasite, a weak creature that can’t survive on its own.

“I’m planning to meet up with Karuizawa-san and the others at 12:30 to have lunch. Do you want to come with? I think it’ll be really fun.” 
...
"I’ll pass. I don’t think I’m on especially good terms with Karuizawa’s group.” Since the end of the first semester, the relationships in our class had been firmly established. How would I go about building friendships with other people at this point? I could already picture Karuizawa and the other girls’ disgust. Even though he didn’t fully understand my fear of other people, Hirata sat next to me. “I can understand that you’re feeling hesitant. That’s exactly why I want you to rely on me.” Hirata wore that eternal, optimistic smile of his. While it was a welcome offer, I shook my head. “You only have about ten minutes before you have to meet them. It’d be better if you just left me here.” “There’s no need to hurry. Besides, I like spending time with you.” To an outsider, my words might have sounded like an excuse, but I was honestly satisfied with the current situation. Back when I had just started school, I’d wanted to make friends. I’d wanted to be able to make a hundred friends, but naturally, everyone settled down into their own separate factions. It was only a matter of course. Even though I’d only been able to talk with the three idiots Horikita, Kushida, and Sakura, my school life wasn’t all that bad. I really believed that. But Hirata wasn’t the type to leave someone be if he saw they were alone. “Well, how about just the two of us have lunch together, you and me? Would that be okay?”
Just the two of us alone. Sitting on the bed together. Hirata turned to me with a serious look. If he lightly pushed me down, things would get out of hand. “Well, I don’t particularly dislike the idea, but… Didn’t you already promise Karuizawa?” “I can eat with Karuizawa-san and the others any time, but I haven’t really had many opportunities to eat together with you, Ayanokouji-kun.” Normally, a guy would do anything to get the chance to eat a meal with a girl. Typical male thinking. However, Hirata seemed able to prioritize eating with another guy without hesitation. It was enough to give me doubts. Perhaps he swung “that way.” Hirata was an effortless multitasker, but he never did anything without reason. “I’d feel bad if Karuizawa blamed you later, though.” I tried to gently turn him down, but it seemed to appeal to his conscience. I wondered if Hirata considered me a trembling newborn fawn that couldn’t even take its first step. “Don’t worry. I don’t think Karuizawasan’s the kind of girl to hold a grudge.” No, no. Karuizawa definitely seemed like that kind of girl. Even though she pretended to be nice in front of Hirata, she was domineering with other ladies. I wondered if Hirata had categorized her as not being “that type of girl.” It reminded me of that teacher from Yomawari Sensei, who showed mercy to bad students. “Okay. I’ll turn Karuizawa-san down for today.” Hirata pulled out his phone to call Karuizawa. I tried to stop him, but Hirata shot me a look. “Is there anything you’d like to eat?” “I can eat just about anything, I guess. Though I’d like to avoid heavy food if possible,” I muttered. The cruise ship had many restaurants. The offerings ranged from junk food like ramen and hamburgers to French cuisine. Since it was still daytime, I wanted to eat something light if possible. I heard Hirata flatly tell Karuizawa that he was cancelling their plans over the phone. I couldn’t hear Karuizawa’s voice clearly, but Hirata abruptly hung up. “Are you really okay with this?” I asked. “Of course. Well then, shall we go to the deck? If we’re just having a light meal, eating there should be easier.” Hirata opened the door, as if to guide me, while I relaxed in bed. Hirata was being his usual concerned self, but taking me out when I wasn’t really that enthusiastic was odd. It seemed kind of forceful for Hirata,
especially since he could normally read any situation well. 

...

It was constructive, and I wanted to lend a hand, but… “Well, in truth, I don’t think I’m on especially good terms with Horikita. Recently, I wondered if we could even be called friends.” “But it does seem like Horikita-san gets along well with you alone, Ayanokouji-kun. You’re special to her.” Special, huh? Hard to believe that someone with over forty friends would say that to someone barely acquainted with one person. Or perhaps it was because he was able to get along with over forty people that Hirata felt frustrated at missing a connection with one particular student. “There’s no need to get impatient, right? The first semester’s only just ended.” Bonds between people must fundamentally strengthen over time. Sometimes, you can place people together under sudden, harsh conditions, like the test on the island, and watch those bonds strengthen overnight. Of course, while you might see instant improvement via that method, those bonds can often be fragile. “Horikita isn’t the type to make friends easily.” I wanted Hirata to understand. “That’s probably true.” Hirata appeared slightly remorseful. Perhaps he felt like he was rushing things again. “I wasn’t thinking about her feelings. I was just thinking of myself.” Hirata shook himself from his reverie. Again, he smiled. “Sorry. I invited you out to eat and made it all about me. Well, let’s eat, shall we?” With that, we started eating our recently-arrived food. However, Hirata looked up and seemed to notice someone approaching us. He shot me a nonplussed look. “Ah, so you’re here after all, Hirata-kun. Let’s eat lunch together!” Karuizawa approached us, leading a group of girls. She sounded happy and carefree. “Um… Karuizawa-san, I thought I canceled our plans…” Hirata stumbled over his words, looking unsure. Meanwhile, Karuizawa and the girls pulled out the chairs from another table, pushed me away, and circled Hirata. Our lunch went from peaceful to noisy in seconds flat. I wasn’t much of a talker, but I wasn’t really concerned. I was used to dealing with situations like this. It was probably time for me to use the special skill I’d acquired since school began, my “Speedy Escape.” I grabbed my food and got up quietly, without making a sound.
Hirata’s eyes met mine for a moment, but the girls closed ranks and he disappeared. Maybe this was one of the select disadvantages of having so many friends. With so much time devoted to others, you didn’t really get any time for yourself. Even if Hirata had issues weighing him down, he couldn’t talk about them with Karuizawa and the others. Instead, he held them unspoken in his heart.

“Pardon the intrusion!” With that, Karuizawa entered the room. 
I’d expected our fourth person would be from Class D, but I hadn’t expected Karuizawa. I’d thought another guy would be joining us. 
This was completely unexpected. 
“Huh? What’s going on? Why are Yukimura-kun and these other guys here?” she asked. 
My thoughts exactly. I couldn’t hide my bewilderment over being included in this bizarre gathering. 
The Professor didn’t seem to worry, but Yukimura looked puzzled. 
“I believe you were told punctuality was key, and yet you’re late. Hurry and take your seat,” Mashima-sensei said.
“Okay.” Karuizawa’s response indicated that she wasn’t thrilled to be here and didn’t much care what the teacher thought.
She sat down and, after studying the three of us, lifted the chair and moved it a little further away from me. 
I felt somewhat depressed that she wanted to get away from me.
“Sotomura, Yukimura, Ayanokouji, and Karuizawa, from Class D. Without further ado, I will now explain the special test.”
Good; at least we were getting an explanation after all. However, the reasoning behind selecting this group of four was still a mystery. We were in a private room, too. I had a bad feeling about this. 
“W-wait a minute. I don’t understand. What do you mean, explain a test? The test was already over, right? Also, what’s the deal with these guys? This is really weird.” 
Karuizawa, unable to listen to anyone else talk, immediately barraged Mashima-sensei with questions. I wondered if she’d even read the message properly. 
“I will not answer any questions at this time. Be quiet and listen.”
Sure enough, Mashima-sensei looked coldly at Karuizawa. 
“Jeez, all right. Fine, I’ll shut up.” 
Mashima-sensei had a reputation of being rather cold to his students. Even now, he seemed aloof during a simple explanation.
My own homeroom teacher, Chabashira-sensei, was also indifferent, cold, and didn’t provide any support to her students. L
ike her, Mashima-sensei didn’t seem like the kind of teacher who would provide a shoulder for Class A students to cry on. 
The only definite difference between the teachers was that in comparison to Chabashira-sensei, who seemed unmotivated and unnaturally uncooperative,
Mashima-sensei was impossible to read. I wondered if he kept everyone at a certain fixed distance, no matter who they were.
“In this special test, all the first-year students will be divided into twelve groups based on the signs of the Zodiac. Everyone will participate within their respective group. The purpose of this examination is to test your thinking.” 
Twelve groups based on the signs of the Zodiac? That meant Class D was divided into three groups, and those three groups would represent three of the twelve signs.
Apparently this would test our “thinking.” They wanted to test our ability to think, and to process information thoroughly. Was that it? 
“What do you mean by ‘test our thinking’?” Karuizawa, unable to stay silent, reflexively spoke up with another question. 
“I’ve already told you. I will not be answering any questions.”
After Mashima-sensei’s second warning, Karuizawa seemed to feel the gravity of our situation. Although she looked blatantly unhappy, she shut her mouth and listened. I didn’t know how seriously Yukimura and the Professor took all this, but they remained silent. “Society needs three fundamental qualities in order to progress: action, thinking, and teamwork. Those with the necessary qualities will become wonderful adults. The previous exam on the uninhabited island focused heavily on testing your teamwork. However, we shall now test your thinking in four ways: your ability to thoroughly process information, which is an essential component of this test. Your ability to analyze your current situation and clarify the task at hand. The ability to solve the problem after you’ve clarified the process and identified the task. The ability to utilize your imagination, and the ability to create new values. Those are the qualities you’ll need.” Although his explanation was rather concise, several question marks were still hanging over everyone’s heads after his brief explanation. I was no better. I still didn’t understand anything at all. “As I’ve said, in this test we have divided you all into twelve groups.” Finally, the words that Karuizawa had longed to hear arrived. “Are there any questions thus far?” “I don’t get what any of this means. Can you explain it in a way that’s easier to understand? I mean, okay, I understand that we’re being divided into twelve groups, but why am I together with these guys? What about Hirata-kun? Or the other girls? And I still don’t get what we’re doing. Tell me. Come on, please?” Even though she attempted politeness at the end, I get the feeling she didn’t mean it. However, Karuizawa was right to have doubts. Even though Mashima-sensei said that he was taking questions, the explanation was ambiguous at best. We still didn’t know what commonality there was between the people gathered here. If each class was divided into three groups, there should have been twelve to fifteen Class D people gathered here for the explanation, but they hadn’t done that. Was it due to the size constraint of the rooms? No, this ship had several rooms that could host a modest-sized gathering. There had to be a reason they’d purposefully sub-divided us.

...

“Ugh, jeez! This sucks! I can’t deal with these three! Hirata-kun would have been so much better!” “Heh. But you know, three heads are better than one. Thus, if the three of us join together, we might be able to surpass the good Hirata-dono, my dear lady,” the Professor said. “Gross. Even if there were a hundred or two hundred of you, you still wouldn’t be worth a single hair on Hirata-kun’s head.” I tried not to care, but hearing her say that kind of thing depressed me. Karuizawa clung close to Hirata day and night, except for whenever she was with her girlfriends. It’s true that we really weren’t fit substitutes for Hirata, but… “Ugh. Well, at any rate, I’ll just report it to Hirata-kun later.” Karuizawa let out a frustrated sigh, then averted her eyes again. Trying to work with her was going to be a hassle, but the same was probably true for Yukimura. “Finished? Please let me continue my explanation.” “Okay, okay. I understand that we’re being divided into these groups, but why is it only the four of us getting this explanation? I thought you’d explain things after our entire group was gathered together. If this is some scheme against us, or some kind of harassment, then I want you to knock it off.” Karuizawa kept talking without pause, as if intending to be disagreeable to the very end. Mashima-sensei remained expressionless. “It would appear that you cannot help but be concerned by this small gathering. Therefore, I will try to provide an answer. This is neither a conspiracy against the students, nor is it harassment. It’s rather simple. The groups don’t consist of members from just one class; they are made up of about three to five individuals collected from each class. If we didn’t explain things in advance, we would run the risk of confusion.” That was why only a few people were gathered into each room. The other three still didn’t seem to understand. They fell silent again, as if they were going over what Mashima-sensei had said in their heads. Of course, I couldn’t immediately digest it, either. We were so quiet that we could hear the clock ticking. “W-wait a minute. What do you mean? I still don’t get it at all. We’re going to be grouped with students from other classes? Isn’t that crazy, though? Aren’t the other classes supposed to be the enemy?”
 ...
CLASS A: Takemoto Shigeru, Machida Kouji, Morishige Takurou CLASS B: Ichinose Honami, Hamaguchi Tetsuya, Beppu Ryouta CLASS C: Ibuki Mio, Manabe Shiho, Yabu Nanami, Yamashita Saki CLASS D: Ayanokouji Kiyotaka, Karuizawa Kei, Sotomura Hideo, Yukimura Teruhiko
 
I know some of the students on the list. Ichinose from Class B; Ibuki from Class C. Apparently, we were teammates now. At this point, I couldn’t really imagine what this exam was going to be. Was it even possible for us to compete alongside other classes, like Karuizawa and Yukimura had said? I quickly glanced out the corner of my eye at Karuizawa. She looked a little perplexed. Being placed into the same group as Ibuki was a perverse kind of fate. “Don’t worry. I will answer any questions you have. I believe you will be able to understand everything afterward. Probably.”

“I hate to say this, but if we have to be in the same group, we need to put up a unified front. A lot of things will depend on who the VIP is, but for now, the four of us should discuss things.” Yukimura spoke as we left Mashima-sensei and walked down the hallway. However, Karuizawa showed no concern at all for the future. Ignoring us, she took out her cell phone and walked away. “H-hey, Karuizawa. Are you listening?!” Karuizawa, totally unconcerned, started to make a call. I was kind of impressed. It was like she had nerves of steel. “Ah, hi, Hirata-kun? There was something I wanted to talk to you about.” She was probably going to complain to Hirata. She quickly strode down the hall and disappeared.

Naturally, the other classes were puzzled as well, not just Class D.
Students mostly divided into natural groups based on their class, but Karuizawa and Ibuki both sat a little further away, as if isolating themselves.
“Why did they…?” I muttered.
“What’s the matter, Ayanokouji? Something on your mind?” 
“It’s nothing,” I said. 
I’d thought for sure that Karuizawa would confront Ibuki the moment she saw her. After all, Ibuki Mio had stolen Karuizawa’s underwear back on the islan.
You’d think she’d want revenge, but… Well, maybe Karuizawa was more mature than I’d thought, or maybe she’d already gotten her revenge.
In any case, it was all rather unnatural.

Karuizawa didn’t understand, but with that simple question, a hierarchy formed within the group. The dam had burst. Yukimura and a girl from Class C named Manabe followed suit. They agreed with Karuizawa and said they obviously wanted to cooperate. If everyone wished for it, we’d all pass the test with Outcome #1. A natural thing to say.

```
“Hey, you’re Karuizawa-san, right? There’s something I wanted to ask you,” said Manabe.
Karuizawa quickly looked up from her phone screen. She hadn’t expected anyone to talk to her. 
“What?” she asked. 
“I might be mistaken, but…did you have a fight with Rika earlier in the summer?” 
“Huh? What are you talking about? Who’s Rika?” asked Karuizawa.
“She’s a girl from our class who wears glasses. She has her hair up in a bun, like a dango. Remember her?”
“I don’t know her. Maybe you’re thinking of someone else.” 
Karuizawa lowered her eyes back to her phone, as if deciding this conversation had nothing to do with her.
However, the next words out of Manabe’s mouth changed things. 
“Isn’t that strange, though? I’m sure we heard about it. We heard that Rika was bulled by a Class D girl named Karuizawa. Rika told us you cut in line and pushed her aside when she was waiting at the café.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Like, do you have some kind of problem with me?” asked Karuizawa.
“No, not really. I’m just checking to see if it’s true. If it is true, though, I’d like you to apologize. Rika is the kind of girl to bottle everything up and stay quiet, so it’s up to us to help her deal with situations like this.” 
Apparently Karuizawa had a reputation as a troublemaker outside our class as well. Class C was hard to deal with as a whole, so this made for big trouble ahead.
Karuizawa decided to ignore Manabe. Manabe, looking frustrated, turned her phone’s camera toward Karuizawa.
“You won’t mind if we check with Rika then, will you? I mean, if it wasn’t you, Karuizawa-san, then there won’t be any problem, right?” asked Manabe. 
Karuizawa looked up and knocked the phone out of Manabe’s hands. She must have done it more forcefully than she thought, because Manabe’s phone tumbled to the ground, spinning as it fell. 
“What the hell?!” shouted Manabe.
“That’s what I should be saying! Don’t just take pictures of me without permission. I already told you that you had the wrong person,” Karuizawa snapped.
Both sides claimed the other was wrong. The conflict was heating up. Ichinose watched it unfold, a bystander. 
It was as if she was trying to determine who was right and wrong. 
“What’ll you do if my phone’s broken?” shouted Manabe. 
“I don’t know! Just ask the school for a new one,” answered Karuizawa.
“I have some really precious photos stored on that phone, though.” 
After hurriedly picking up her phone, Manabe glared at Karuizawa with resentment.
Two of the other Class C students, who’d been watching the situation unfold, came to help Manabe stare Karuizawa down.
“What? Are you saying I’m the bad guy here?” asked Karuizawa. 
“If it wasn’t you, you wouldn’t get all angry and deny it like that, right? Let us take your picture,” said Manabe. 
“But I don’t want you to.” 
I thought that Karuizawa would’ve answered Manabe more forcefully, but her words were surprisingly weak.
Or rather, there was some fear mixed in with her “tough girl” act. It might’ve been my imagination, though.
“Perhaps the reason you’re denying it so much is because it’s true?” asked Manabe.
Manabe pointed her phone’s camera at Karuizawa, as if intending to forcefully take her picture. The other two girls from Class C laughed like they were enjoying it.
However, Ibuki didn’t share their sentiment. She looked scornfully over at Manabe, showing her contempt.
“Stupid,” said Ibuki. 
“‘Stupid’? What? This has nothing to do with you, Ibuki-san. You’re not friends with Rika, after all.”
“That’s right. This absolutely has nothing to do with me. So I said what I thought as an outsider.” 
Ibuki crossed her arms and looked away. Manabe didn’t appear to care for Ibuki’s attitude at all, but did not confront her.
There was probably a clearly established hierarchy in Class C, and Ibuki was above Manabe. 
“Anyway, just let me take your picture!” shouted Manabe.
“No, I don’t want you to! Come on. Please, say something to her,” Karuizawa pleaded. For some reason, she turned to Machida, begging him to intervene. 
“I won’t forgive you if you take my picture without permission. What do you think, Machida-kun?”
“I agree. Manabe, Karuizawa has told you that she doesn’t want you to take her picture. Stop it,” Machida added. 
“M-Machida-kun, this has nothing to do with you,” answered Manabe. 
“From what I’ve heard just now, I think you’re the one in the wrong here, Manabe. Karuizawa told you she doesn’t know what you’re talking about, so it’s wrong for you to forcefully take her picture. Don’t you agree? I think it’s best to talk to your friend again and confirm if the story is true.” 
Judging this situation fairly, Machida was correct. I certainly understood Manabe’s feelings in wanting to take the picture to ascertain the truth, but if the person tells you no, taking a picture without permission is rude.
Confronted with that argument, Manabe and the other girls had no choice but to back down, though Manabe didn’t seem wholly convinced. 
“Come on, lay off me. Thank you, Machida-kun,” said Karuizawa. Karuizawa looked up at him, her eyes full of gratitude.
Even though the Class A students had distanced themselves from the rest of the group, they weren’t bad guys at all. 
Takemoto and the others didn’t appear to be too interested, though. 
“All I did was the right thing.” Machida blushed slightly.
Perhaps this was the beginning of a new love? Karuizawa already had Hirata, though.
Regardless, I got the feeling that the friction between Karuizawa and those Class C students would spark some real problems down the road.

Karuizawa, completely exhausted, got up to leave but accidentally pitched forward. Perhaps her legs were numb from sitting for so long.
“Ouch!” shouted Manabe. 
In a panic, Karuizawa had attempted to correct her footing, but staggered and stepped on Manabe’s foot. 
“Ah, I didn’t mean to do that. I’m sorry,” Karuizawa mumbled, apologizing quickly before leaving the room.
“Hey, what the hell?!” shouted Manabe. 
She yelled at the rest of us as we left. I didn’t want to get caught in the middle of anything, so I averted my eyes and got out of there.

Karuizawa sighed and went back to fiddling with her phone. 
While there wasn’t any rule prohibiting phone use during the test, doing so while we were trying to find the VIP was a little rude. 
Or maybe she was like the CIA or FBI, communicating with Hirata in real time so he could listen to our conversation? 
I’d respect her if that were true, but it probably wasn’t the case. 
Of course, knowing that Karuizawa didn’t usually put serious effort into anything, this wasn’t out of character. 
But something felt off. It felt like something had been off ever since the test started. Karuizawa; the reunion with Ibuki; confronting Manabe.
I realized that none of the things she’d been doing lately seemed like the “usual” Karuizawa. She was a strong presence in Class D.
Whatever her reputation, she and Hirata often brought the class together. But here, she was practically a background character. 
She had the potential to motivate others, and she wasn’t using it. When someone spoke to her, she would answer and then immediately shrink away. 
Hirata was always Hirata, no matter the situation, and Kushida was always Kushida. However, that didn’t seem to be true for Karuizawa.

“Hey. Do you have a minute?”
Manabe looked slightly on her guard, probably because she hadn’t expected me to come after her.
“I heard about your problem with Karuizawa. Something about her pushing someone at the café, right?”
“Yeah. Why do you ask?” snapped Manabe. 
These girls wouldn’t normally want to chat with me, but that topic seemed to interest them. All three focused on me, like they were checking me out.
“I’m not 100% sure, but I think I saw Karuizawa fight with a girl from another class,” I said.
“That’s… Are you sure?” asked Manabe.
Her voice was stiff, and she drew nearer. I shrunk slightly and nodded.
“I think so. Well, I just kind of got this bad vibe, you know? I felt like she was acting like a jerk, so I thought I’d go ahead and tell you.”

“Oh, uh, that’s not really what I meant. I meant there was something I wanted to ask you, as a girl.” 
Since she’d probably get angrier no matter what I did, I cut to the chase.
“I want information on Karuizawa.”
I’d planned to contact Karuizawa, but had never talked to her before. If Karuizawa ranked the boys in our class, I likely would’ve been last.
“You want to talk to me about Karuizawa?”
“Yes, exactly.” I nodded. 
“I’d like to know more about the people in my group, but it’s not easy. I should be able find out whatever I need to about the Professor and Yukimura, but I’m at a complete loss with Karuizawa. After the test on the island ended, Karuizawa invited you out to lunch. Right?”
“I turned her down, though. You know that. I have no interest in Karuizawa-san. If you want information on her, why not talk to Hirata-kun? If he’s helping you, you’ll be able to contact her easily.” 
That was certainly true. Unfortunately, prior to the test, I had also passed on the opportunity to have lunch with Karuizawa.
Hirata probably remembered that, so I wanted to avoid asking him about this.
“Do you think she’s the VIP? Is that what you’re worried about?” Horikita asked.
“There’s that. But more than that, I can’t understand Karuizawa’s behavior. That’s why I’m worried.” 
“Well, isn’t that none of your business? Besides, her behavior isn’t logical. I think it’s a waste of time,” she countered. 
“Horikita, I don’t think it’s good to write people off like that.” 
“Write them off? What are you talking about?” 
“You and Karuizawa don’t get along at all because you’re both willful, so you see her as nothing more than a nuisance. You understand that she may also have strong points, too?”
“She has strong points? I can’t really imagine any. Isn’t she just flawed?” 
In terms of cooperativeness, Horikita was probably at the same level or even worse than Karuizawa. 
“When you first see someone, you make judgments based on their appearance. You might determine if someone is cool or cute, for instance. Basically, you read people. Call it your first impression; that’s simple enough. Next, you learn about their inner self through conversation and seeing them in action. You’ll see whether they’re sociable, belligerent, passive, etc.” 
Horikita crossed her arms, acting like my words were obvious. She waited for me to continue.
“But that’s still just as superficial as their outside appearance. Their innermost thoughts aren’t going to be immediately apparent from that. For example, take Kushida, Ibuki, or even me. There’s a difference between a person’s outer and inner selves.”
“So Karuizawa has some secret self?”
“Almost everyone does. They may not be aware of it themselves. You do, too.” Whenever she came face to face with her older brother, she exposed her fragility.

“I checked with Karuizawa, too. She said that she’s not the VIP, but whether I believe her is another issue.
” Yukimura normally showed disdain for Karuizawa, so he tended not to believe what she said. 
He’d know the truth for sure if he checked her phone, but given that they had a tenuous relationship, that would be difficult.

This was an event that happened not long after the special test started.

I went earlier to the Rabbit group exam room.

“I’ve come a bit early… but whatever”

Actually I didn’t intend to arrive this early, but approximately 10 minutes is still in an acceptable extent.

I only wanted to avoid meeting with Manabe and the other girls.

The reason being “that incident”. Reopening old wounds in these unexpected circumstances had disrupted my mood. Standing worried in front of the door of the room was also strange, so I simply entered directly into the room. Eg… I only saw Ayanokouji-kun waiting alone sitting on a chair alone after entering the room. The disgusted expression I adopted in a flash was seen by him, but it didn’t matter.

I didn’t want to approach him, so I made some distance with him. I chose the furthest place from him and I sat down.

During the period of time after this, I was passing time chatting with my friends with my phone.

After that, Rino wanted to have a phone call, so we did that.

“Ah, hello Rino. What’s the situation over there? This side? Ah--, this side is not just terrible, the situation is at the limit. Even if I’m being separated from Hirata-kun, at least give they should give me some decent guys. This group is really full of malice.”

It looked like there were a lot of girls in the group where Rino was allocated, so envious. I was having complicated feelings about thinking that they were in high spirits during my absence. Girls are certainly organisms that gossip behind the people they hate. In order to avoid issues from appearing after the test was finished, I should scout out in advance, in order to control them. This is the most important thing I should really be doing right now. After finishing the phone call with a few words, I inspected the chat log from start to finish to look for suspicious things. En, there shouldn’t be any problem. At present my presence is still working.

Ayanokouji-kun, who was clamly waiting in the room, entered my field of vision.

“Ah—right. Are you the Target? It seems that neither Yukimura-kun nor So…-kun are.”

This thing was not important. I only asked in order to pass the time. How should I put it, I didn’t have any impression of this guy. He was an unremarkable guy in the classroom, but I could still find him from the corners of my memory. Why? Just by thinking a little I arrived at the answer.

Just from appearance alone, Ayanokouji-kun doesn’t look bad at all. If he could socialize as well as Hirata-kun, maybe he could become a person whose popularity wouldn’t lose to him.

“I’m not”

He answered me briefly. No, totally impossible, he doesn’t possess dialogue skills. That’s why he is always mixed with old fashioned girls like Horikita-san and Sakura-san.

“Ah, I see. Then it’s okay”

“Do you believe me?”

Was it because I was suspicious? Ayanokouji-kun looked at me while saying this.

“Hah? You probably aren’t, right?”

I gave a slightly angry reply and he immediately shifted his gaze and stayed silent. You are a man, so embarrassing.

It’s useless to keep chatting with him. While thinking this, I took out my phone again.

In the end, besides Hirata-kun, there are no real men in class D.

That’s why I can’t leave his side.

“That reminds me. So, are you the VIP? It seems like…Yukimurakun and that Soto…kun aren’t,” said Karuizawa. 
Wow, she was talking to me. At least she could remember Sotomura’s name. Yukimura had asked me that same question a little while ago.
I suppose it made sense that everyone wanted to check. 
“Nope,” I answered.
“Ah, okay. That’s fine.”
However, unlike Yukimura, she didn’t double-check.
“Do you believe me?” I asked. 
“Huh? You said you’re not, didn’t you?” 
Even though we didn’t get along well, she seemed to believe what I said. Well, there really wasn’t any need to press the issue.
I wasn’t looking to get more points in this test. What was important was ascertaining whether Karuizawa could be useful to me.

Class A kept its distance from the rest of us, so the rest of us formed a circle. Then, Karuizawa got up and sat down next to Machida from Class A.
Probably a defensive measure against Manabe. Machida didn’t participate in the discussion, but we felt his presence very strongly.
There was also a power imbalance, and Class C, which only had girls like Manabe, didn’t really have any charismatic members who could go up against Machida.
...
“Don’t worry. If anything happens, I’ll help you,” said Machida.
“Thank you, Machida-kun,” she replied. 
Since Karuizawa had started depending on Machida, he seemed very conscious of her. 
I mean, she was a really cute girl, so it was understandable that he’d want to protect her. Even if they were from different classes.
Leaving aside their new (and dangerous) affections, the test was the problem. We all understood that.
We understood that what separated victory from defeat was finding out whether your class had the VIP.

Next came the other Class D students: the Professor and Karuizawa.
Rather than coming here together, it looked like they’d arrived at the same time by sheer coincidence.
Karuizawa appeared openly disgusted by the Professor’s presence. After they entered, she quickly moved toward the back of the room.
“Hey, aren’t you sitting in my seat?” asked Karuizawa. 
Despite being late, she glared at the Class C girls. After seeing them being so friendly with Machida, she seemed even more frustrated.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about. What do you mean, your seat? Just sit anywhere. Any spot should be fine.” 
“Well, that’s the seat I want. That’s my spot. Move,” urged Karuizawa.
“Huh? I’m talking to Machida-kun right now. He promised to hang out with me tonight,” said Manabe. 
“Hey, Machida-kun. Could you please tell her that you want me next to you?” 
Machida looked a little troubled by the situation, hesitating over which girl he should pick.
However, Karuizawa quickly inserted herself between Manabe and Machida, and grabbed his hand. 
“How about we spend some time together, just the two of us? Or have you promised that girl you’ll go with her? I hate two-timers. If you’re going to mess around with that girl then that’ll be the end of it, I guess,” said Karuizawa. 
Whoa. I was amazed she could say that with a straight face, given that she was already dating Hirata. 
The “just the two of us” part really seemed to strike a chord with Machida. It appeared he’d made his decision. 
“Excuse me, but would you please move? That’s the seat Karuizawa’s been sitting in,” said Machida.
“Huh? What the hell? Ugh, this is bull,” Manabe whined.
The girls, looking upset, promptly got up and left. Karuizawa moved into the empty seat. 
Actually, she scooted so close that she was practically glued to Machida. Seriously, they were right next to each other, their bodies pressed together.
Karuizawa’s actions didn’t seem petty or frivolous to me, but that was probably because I already knew what kind of person she was.
Karuizawa was dating Hirata. Whether or not Machida knew that, it looked like he’d started to fall for her. 
Appearance-wise, she was most definitely cute. Also, from the perspective of someone with a crush, it made sense that he’d want to protect her.

Meanwhile, the Class A students, typically the last to leave, were the first out the door.
Well, not everyone in Class A had left yet. Machida and Karuizawa were exchanging contact information. Yukimura and the Professor got up.
“I think it’s time to head back. You coming, Ayanokouji?” Yukimura asked.
“Yeah.”
While we spoke, Karuizawa answered her phone and stood. She exited the room, chatting away on the phone, seemingly talking about something funny or interesting.
As she walked away, the three Class C girls brushed past me and made their way out. 
“Hey. Did you get a weird vibe from those three just now?” asked Yukimura. 
He turned to me with a slightly puzzled look. 
“You think so? I can’t say that I noticed anything of the sort,” answered the Professor. 
The Professor’s tone was ridiculously pompous. However, I thought Yukimura’s feelings were right on the money. 
The Class C girls had looked considerably angry. Yukimura and I peered into the hallway to see what was going on.
We saw the three girls closely following Karuizawa. Being alone, she was at a disadvantage. The situation had me worried.
Also, Ibuki, who might’ve mitigated the other three, wasn’t around. 
“You think they have a bone to pick with her?” asked Yukimura. 
“Let’s follow them. I don’t think there’ll be violence, but it could lead to an uproar.” 
“Damn Karuizawa. She’s always making people hate her. I wanted us to spend our precious time finding the VIP,” 
Yukimura grumbled. While the Professor headed back to his room, Yukimura and I quietly chased the four girls.

“Hey. why’d you bring me to a place like this?!”
“Stop playing dumb! You did push Rika, didn’t you? Start talking.”
“H-huh? I already told you, you’ve got the wrong person!”
The three girls surrounded Karuizawa, forcing her up against the wall.
They were preventing her from escaping. However, even surrounded, Karuizawa offered no apologies.
She continued to deny what they were saying. Maybe she really was innocent.
“Look, I have plans later. Can you please move?” asked Karuizawa.
“Okay, let’s confirm it right now. I’m going to call Rika. If it wasn’t you, we’ll forgive you.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about. I’ll call the teacher.”
“And what will you tell the teacher, exactly? It’s not like we’re being violent with you or anything. Besides, if you talk to the teacher, we’ll tell on you, too. We’ll say you pushed Rika. You’ll also get in trouble.”
Neither side intended to back down. Karuizawa tried to escape, but the girls grabbed her arm and pushed her up against the wall. 
One of the girls took out her phone, probably to call Rika. “W-wait!” Karuizawa pleaded with them to not call.
“What? Why should we wait?”
“I just remembered something. I bumped into that girl before.”
“You’re a total liar. You remembered her from the very beginning, didn’t you? Well, whatever. So, are you going to apologize to Rika properly?”
“No way. She was in the wrong. She’s a complete airhead.” 
I would’ve thought Karuizawa would take responsibility for her actions, but instead, she refused. She refused despite knowing it would upset them. 
“You’re seriously pissing us off. We might’ve forgiven you if you’d actually apologized to Rika. But now, we definitely won’t forgive you.” 
The girl pressed down against Karuizawa’s shoulder. 
“Whatever. You probably never planned on forgiving me.”
After Karuizawa spat out those words, one of the girls, Yamashita, lost her patience. 
“Shiho-chan. I’ve had enough. Karuizawa’s unforgivable.”
“I know, right? She should understand exactly how Rika felt. Why don’t we bully her for real?” 
She struck Karuizawa’s shoulder with a little extra force. Yukimura started to throw the door open, but I grabbed his arm.
Even if we stepped in now, Karuizawa would be threatened again at some point. 
However, if they got even a little violent while we were watching them, it’d be a deterrent for later.
Also, depending on how violent they got, we could possibly threaten them, telling them we’d report them to the school. 
More importantly, Karuizawa Kei looked like she was starting to change. 
“Ahh…ahh…” She panted as if she were having a hard time breathing.
She held her head in her hands as if she were in pain. When Manabe and the others saw her suffering, they weren’t sympathetic.
The opposite, actually. It irritated them.

“Act as girly as you want, we’re still not going to forgive you.” 
They grabbed Karuizawa’s hair and forcefully yanked her head up. 
“I’ve always hated your face, Karuizawa. I mean, don’t you girls think she’s just butt-ugly?” 
“Yeah, for sure. Don’t you just want to cut her face?” 
“St-stop. Stop it.”
“‘St-stop it’, she says.What happened to your big attitude?” 
The more you envied your enemy, the more you hated them, to the point where you wanted to strip away their advantages. 
If we were talking looks, then Karuizawa had them all beat.
But Manabe, Yamashita, and Yabu wouldn’t be satisfied until they’d verbally torn Karuizawa’s pretty face apart. 
Karuizawa trembled, frightened. She was on the verge of tears, still unable to move.
People show their true colors when they’re in jeopardy. A little more pressure, and I’d know who Karuizawa Kei really was. 
However, Yukimura couldn’t stand by any longer. He threw open the door. The three girls were naturally shocked by his sudden appearance.
Karuizawa, on the other hand, looked like he’d saved her life. 
“What are you doing?!” Yukimura shouted.
“What? Nothing. Right? We were just talking to Karuizawa-san. Yeah?”
Manabe glared at Karuizawa, as if telling her not to say another word. But Karuizawa wasn’t the sort to shy away.
“Yukimura-kun, these girls just abducted me and started getting all violent. They’re seriously the worst, aren’t they? They were being, like, super annoying, so I told them to get lost,” said Karuizawa.
She’d normally never talk to Yukimura, but she was probably grateful to him now. Meanwhile, the Class C girls glared at Yukimura.
Their eyes seemed to say, “This has nothing to do with you.”
“Well, I’m just talking with Karuizawa about her problem, what she did to Rika. You heard how Karuizawa slammed into her, right?”
“Don’t you think it’s better to just let things go? They bumped into each other. It’s not like Karuizawa was at fault,” Yukimura said. 
“You shut up. This has nothing to do with you.”
“…” 
Under the weight of their glares, he fell silent. Karuizawa shot a look at Yukimura, like she thought he was pathetic. 
She quietly took out her phone. 
“Just leave me alone. If you don’t, I’ll call someone.”
“Who are you going to call? Hirata-kun? Machida-kun? I mean, I guess a slut like you has a hundred guys on speed dial, right?”
Fights between girls often got dirty, and unlike with men, violence wasn’t really an option.
This was painful to watch. 
“A teacher was just here. I think it’d be better if you left,” I said.
I had no other choice but to step in and break this up. Class C probably didn’t want to cause a scene. 
“You better bow your head and apologize to Rika.” 
The Class C girls kept intimidating Karuizawa, who desperately tried to keep a brave face. But it was obvious that she’d lost her confidence.
The other girls seemed to know that. They continued their hostility. 
“Are you okay?” asked Yukimura, who seemed unable to leave Karuizawa to their mercy.
She was hyperventilating.
“Just leave me alone!” As Yukimura drew nearer, Karuizawa slapped his hand away.
“Hey, what the hell? I only came to check on you because I was worried!” 
“God, shut up! Nobody asked you!”
Karuizawa’s breathing grew even more ragged. Yukimura stepped back, overpowered. 
I decided to let sleeping dogs lie and stepped back, too. 
Karuizawa glared at me as she opened the emergency stairwell door and slammed it as hard as she could after she left.
“Jeez, what’s with her? She’s always, always causing trouble for people!” 
I understood Yukimura’s feelings of resentment. Karuizawa was certainly a troublemaker. 
Yukimura, seemingly exhausted from the ordeal, left without saying another word. 
I stood alone in the emergency stairwell and thought about Karuizawa. The leader of the Class D girls had shown her vulnerable side.
However, the threats hadn’t frightened her; she’d been terrified for another reason.
```
##### 35change
```
It was around two in the morning when my roommate quietly woke up. 
Taking extreme consideration as to not wake the other three people in the room, Hirata slipped out of bed. 
Since students were required to sleep in their jerseys, he stole out of the room while still wearing it. 
After I’d confirmed he wasn’t going to the men’s room, I grabbed my keycard and got out of bed myself. 
There was no guarantee he’d make a move today, but it seemed like my labors had begun to bear fruit. 
Once he realized that I was awake, we exchanged glances without speaking a word. 
Without looking away, I told him there was something I needed to talk to him about. 
He said he’d be waiting in the hall. Then, he stepped out. I found him in the hallway, wearing a troubled look.
“Did I wake you? Or were you already awake?” he asked. 
“The latter. I thought you might be leaving the room tonight,” I said. 
“Why would you think that? This was the first time I’ve left the room at night.”
Trying to deceive him would have a detrimental effect, so I thought it best to just be honest.
“Karuizawa contacted you, didn’t she?” 
Hirata seemed to understand what I was getting at, just as I’d expect. His comprehension skills were flawless.
“Do you happen to know something about it?” he asked. 
“Well, I’m in her group. I don’t know how much she’s told you, but I get the situation.”
Hirata waited for me to continue. Well, considering I’d chased him down in the middle of the night, it had to appear urgent.
“You said you wanted to act as a bridge between Horikita and the rest of the class, right? This has to do with that,” I said. 
“I see. So Horikita-san told you to talk to me, Ayanokouji-kun?”
He’d saved me a lot of trouble. Now I didn’t have to bother with a lengthy explanation. 
“She asked me to report on everything that happens in the Rabbit group, including Karuizawa’s situation. Once I heard about what happened with Karuizawa, Horikita told me to keep an eye on you, too, Hirata. She told me to follow you. But you said you wanted to be a bridge for her, so I thought this might be the chance to finally make that happen.”
“What kind of information does she want?” he asked. 
“Everything you know about Karuizawa. Also, whatever it was you talked to her about.” 
Hirata probably didn’t see why I needed information about Karuizawa. However, he seemed to understand the impact this could potentially have.
“I don’t know what I can tell you, honestly. I have to consider Karuizawa-san’s feelings.”
With that, Hirata started walking away. I decided to just follow him at a slow, unhurried pace.
Even though I’d been in bed for about two hours, I didn’t have bedhead.
I didn’t really worry about personal grooming most of the time, but I knew I had to take it into consideration when I was with other people.
I didn’t want to make them uncomfortable when they looked at me.
“Ayanokouji-kun, I’m sure you won’t say anything unnecessary, but what I’m about to tell you is extremely delicate. Also, Karuizawa-san might refuse to talk and head back to her room. Please understand that first,” he said. 
I could always eavesdrop on them, but Hirata probably wouldn’t like that. 
Since this was something Karuizawa didn’t want others to hear, she’d called for him in the middle of the night.
He’d never approve of me listening in from the shadows. My best bet was to just give him a straight, honest answer. 
The meeting place was in front of the vending machine near the second-level lounge area. 
Being in the center of the hallway, it was easy for people to see us, but its placement also meant that we could see them. 
Its location made eavesdropping difficult. Karuizawa was already waiting for Hirata, clad in her jersey and sitting on the sofa. 
When Karuizawa saw Hirata coming, she instantly smiled, but when she noticed me trailing slightly behind, her joy was replaced with anger. 
She stood and shouted at me. 
“What’re you doing here, Ayanokouji-kun?!” “I asked him to come,” said Hirata. 
“You did, Hirata-kun? Why? I told you I wanted to talk alone.” 
“I know. But Karuizawa-san, I was worried about what you told me earlier. That’s why I thought it might be a good idea to bring Ayanokouji-kun, since he seems to understand the situation. I’m sorry for not telling you first.”
Karuizawa looked upset, but it didn’t seem like she’d snap at Hirata.
“But…I said I wanted to talk alone, just the two of us,” she repeated. 
“If you want, we can be alone. But when we spoke earlier, you never said anything about it having to be just the two of us.”
I already assumed this was related to the trouble she’d had with the Class C girls, but I wondered how Karuizawa would approach the topic.
If she just wanted to vent her anger, there’d be no reason for it to be just the two of them.
Karuizawa had wanted to talk about something without any third parties present. That meant she wouldn’t talk about it if I were here. 
Perhaps because he was impatient, or perhaps because he thought silence was pointless, Hirata started talking about their earlier phone call.
“You were telling me about a fight with Manabe-san from Class C. Is it true?” he asked. 
Karuizawa opened her mouth slightly to answer, but said nothing, perhaps because she was still wary of my presence. Hirata once again broke the silence.
“Ayanokouji-kun, did you know about the fight with Manabe-san and the others?” he asked. 
“Sort of.” 
Since this wasn’t working, Hirata attempted to shift the conversation. It looked like he intended to ask me questions.
Karuizawa seemed dissatisfied, but she continued to listen. 
“From what Karuizawa-san has told me, it seems like the girls were making false accusations. They took her to a deserted spot and started hounding her for answers. They were on the verge of using violence,” Hirata said. 
“Yeah. That’s all true. I saw it myself. Yukimura saw it, too.”
“I see.” 
Hirata looked momentarily lost in thought and closed his eyes. I wondered what he’d do. 
Would he call Manabe and her friends out and reprimand them? Or would he report them to the school?
“If Manabe-san and her friends got violent with you, we definitely need to take action. I absolutely cannot allow violence,” he continued.
When Karuizawa heard Hirata’s just words, she momentarily broke into a smile. But when she saw me looking at her, her expression changed back to anger. 
“Karuizawa-san, they were so cruel that you were completely overwhelmed, and couldn’t stand it. Right?” I asked.
“No.”
Karuizawa tried to answer, but seemingly couldn’t. She just glared at me without saying anything more.
I couldn’t lie, so I just told Hirata what I’d seen. Apparently, Karuizawa and some girl named Rika had some trouble in the past. 
Manabe and her friends wanted to make Karuizawa apologize. But then they’d almost gotten violent with Karuizawa. 
Hirata, after hearing the whole story, nodded as if I’d filled in some gaps.
“I see. So that’s why you told me,” he said.
“Told you what?” I asked. 
“Karuizawa-san asked me to take revenge on Manabe-san and her friends.”
I hadn’t expected such unsettling words. Then again, from the perspective of someone who’d been physically threatened, it must’ve looked like a kill-or-be-killed situation. 
After Hirata spoke, Karuizawa finally broke her silence. 
“Why did you tell him?” she asked. 
“Because this isn’t like you, Karuizawa-san. You aren’t a violent person,” Hirata answered. 
“But your girlfriend’s suffering, right? You should want to help me.”
“Yes, I do. But I don’t believe in an eye for an eye. You know that, don’t you?” 
Their core differences were starting to clash. 
“Let’s think this through. If possible, let’s find a way to get along with Manabe-san and her friends,” he said.
“That’s impossible, isn’t it? I mean, they absolutely hate me for practically no reason. Please, you have to understand!” she begged.
“No reason? Didn’t this start because you had an issue with Morofuji-san, Karuizawa?” Hirata said Morofuji, but he probably meant Rika.
That must’ve been her last name. It was amazing how much information he had.
“But that’s… I didn’t have any choice! Shinohara and the others were there, and—” 
“So because Shinohara was there, you had no choice? What does that mean?” I asked.
“You shut your mouth!” she screamed. Her voice carried all the way down the hallway. 
“Please, I’m begging you. Help me. Hirata-kun. You said you’d protect me, didn’t you?” 
“Of course I’ll protect you. But I can’t just hurt Manabe-san and her friends for no real reason. Let’s try to find a way to resolve things peacefully, through discussion.” 
“I’m telling you, it’s not possible! If I could do that, I wouldn’t need your help!” 
What she said might have sounded absurd, but I understood how she felt. Karuizawa’s position was more dangerous than I expected. 
Things might very well end violently. For example, students here weren’t allowed to smoke, much like many other schools around the world.
But there were many students worldwide who smoked and got away with it. Not everything could be bound by law or governed by rules, and bullying was one of those things.
Hirata did seem to be worried about Karuizawa, but he was also worried about Manabe and her friends. 
Hirata wanted to think of a way to resolve things peacefully for all parties. He wasn’t treating Karuizawa like his treasured girlfriend, but as another friend. 
“It doesn’t matter what the reason is. I can’t do what you want. You’re one of my classmates, Karuizawa-san. If you’re in trouble, I’ll help you, protect you. But I can’t hurt someone else to do that, even if they’re from Class C,” he said. 
“You liar! You said you’d protect me!” she shouted. 
“‘Liar’? You’ve known this was my stance since the beginning.” He stood up. 
The next words out of his mouth would’ve taken all the Class D students by surprise. 
“I’ve told you from the start that we aren’t really boyfriend and girlfriend. I don’t mind pretending to go out with you, but I definitely won’t fight a war for you.” 
Apparently, their relationship was a huge lie. 
“What?! Wh-why are you saying all of this now?!”
Karuizawa was horrified by what she’d just heard. I understood Hirata’s intentions.
He was using Karuizawa to extract information as a tribute to Horikita. That was what it looked like, anyway.
“Because we need a new option now. I want to help you,” he said. He wasn’t abandoning Karuizawa at all.
He was seriously trying to help her, in his own way. He approached Karuizawa, who now looked really upset, but didn’t even try to touch her slender, delicate shoulder.
I would’ve expected him to do that much.
“So are you saying…it’s better for me to get violent with them?” she asked. 
“That’s not what I’m saying. I’ll do what I can to help you. When morning comes, I intend to speak with Manabe-san and her friends. I’ll tell them to stop harassing you, Karuizawa-san. You probably won’t like this, but I’ll tell them that you’ll apologize.”
“I don’t want to!” 
Karuizawa had come to Hirata in order to take revenge on Manabe and her friends, and that spoke to her true personality— her real self. 
More than anything else, Karuizawa was afraid. 
“If that’s the case, then I can’t help you. I’m sorry.” 
Hirata was calm. Even now, he was composed. But he was also extremely reliable, and for someone like Karuizawa who needed that reliability, losing it was basically a death sentence. 
“Ayanokouji-kun, do you have any ideas?” asked Hirata. I
t seemed like he was trying to make me take a more active role in this.
“Whatever! If you’re not going to listen to me, then I don’t need you!” 
Karuizawa threw the can of juice she was holding down the hall. The contents spilled all over the place, and the sound echoed down the hall.
“Our relationship is over. It’s over!” she shouted. 
With that, Karuizawa abandoned us and fled. Hirata seemed annoyed not because the truth of their sham relationship had been revealed, but because he couldn’t help her.
He showed no signs of running after her. She wasn’t his priority. 
“Ayanokouji-kun. I have my limits. I can’t do everything. Please understand that,” he said.
I’d planned to use Hirata to extract information about Karuizawa. 
However, it appeared that Hirata had used me instead, and used this opportunity to task me with saving Karuizawa from her troubles.
“You said that you wanted to be a bridge to connect people, but that’s a lie, isn’t it? You’re everyone’s ally.” 
“Yes. I’m Karuizawa-san’s ally, and I’m your ally as well, Ayanokouji-kun. However, my priorities might change depending on the situation. You’re far more capable than everyone thinks,” Hirata observed.
“You think way too highly of me.” “Really? I’m good at reading other people. That’s why I understand.”
I wanted to ask more about this supposed skill but decided that we should resolve this problem first.
“Your relationship with Karuizawa sounds like it was all for show. Is that really true?” I asked.
“When you put it that way, it sounds like you already suspected as much.” 
“You and Karuizawa have been dating for almost four months, but your relationship with her hadn’t progressed much. Of course, I considered the possibility that you were maintaining a pure and platonic kind of relationship, but even then, you’ve always kept yourself distant from her. You still call each other by your last names.” 
Even if they hadn’t gotten closer physically, they should’ve grown nearer emotionally. 
But Hirata and Karuizawa’s relationship had showed absolutely no signs of change, for better or for worse. In a romantic relationship, such stagnation was exceptionally odd.
“You’re exactly right. We weren’t really dating. We were going out because we both felt that it was necessary. I suppose you consider that contradictory,” he answered.
In other words, theirs had been a mutually beneficial relationship. In that case, which one of them had proposed the idea, and which had agreed to it? 
Well, I suppose that was obvious. Karuizawa had asked Hirata to pretend to go out with her, and Hirata had simply honored her request. 
With that in mind, her actions made more and more sense. 
“The rumors started roughly three weeks after school began. From that point onward, Karuizawa’s popularity soared by leaps and bounds,” I observed.
A similar phenomenon had occurred in Rabbit Group. By attaching herself to Machida, Karuizawa could assert herself more aggressively than normal, and her level of influence had increased.
To Karuizawa, Hirata was basically a host, and she was his parasite. He’d been a tool to enhance her social standing. 
“You played the part of Karuizawa’s boyfriend so that her social standing would improve.” 
I’d arrived at the truth. In response, Hirata simply smiled. I’d thought that was the entire truth, but then I realized that it didn’t explain everything.
Besides, Hirata hadn’t admitted that I was right. Karuizawa had used Hirata and Machida to place herself at the top of the school’s caste system? 
No, that alone wasn’t enough. After all, why would Hirata have accepted her request so easily? That was a tall order for him. 
Karuizawa’s aggressive attitude was getting more and more out of hand every day. She was behaving more like a bully. 
Why would Hirata approve of this and not criticize her at all? Besides, did Karuizawa really just want to use Hirata and the others to get to the top?
I was doubtful. I couldn’t say she’d used Machida just to increase her influence. If anything, she showed no interest in the group.
More often than not, she just sat in silence. Maybe she hadn’t planned to use Machida at first.
In that case, what had triggered her to establish contact with Machida? I felt like I was starting to discover Karuizawa Kei’s true self. “It’s to protect herself?” I asked. That was the only remaining answer. There was no mistaking it. 
...
“You’ve already said as much, but I agreed to act like Karuizawa-san’s boyfriend so she could protect herself. That’s what she wanted. She said she wanted me to save her. It might be a little difficult for you to imagine, but throughout her elementary and junior high years, she was viciously bullied.”
“Is that really the truth?” I asked. 
So Karuizawa’s hyperventilation had been triggered by memories of her past.
If she had suffered such deep trauma, it explained why she couldn’t shake off the earlier encounter.
“Of course, I only met Karuizawa-san after she started school here. But I understood. People who are bullied give off a unique vibe. That’s why I agreed to go out with her. That way, Karuizawa-san would free herself from her past by using her position as my girlfriend. I don’t think that Karuizawa-san has been showing us her real personality. I think she’s just desperately trying to act tough.” 
That was why she couldn’t control her emotions very well. Many people who’ve been bullied tended to have very meek and timid personalities, like Sakura. 
On the other hand, people who were confident, aggressive, and selfish—those who acted like Karuizawa—were typically the ones doing the bullying.
So Karuizawa’s personality was a façade. A front. That’s why she needed people like Hirata and Machida. With them, she was able to get that assertive personality. 
“Wait a minute. What was in it for you?” I asked. High school is one of the prime romantic times of a student’s life. Hirata was popular with girls. If he pretended to go out with Karuizawa, he couldn’t pursue a relationship with anyone else. “What was in it for me? Karuizawa-san wasn’t being bullied. That’s all I needed.”
...
“Hirata. Since you have a large social network, I have a favor to ask.” I handed Hirata a piece of paper. He read it and accepted my request without so much as a displeased look. “Oh, Ayanokouji-kun. There is one more thing I’ve been hiding from you. I know the identity of the last VIP from Class D.”

In truth, they're just pretending to be in a relationship in order for Kei to not get bullied in school ~~so it is unknown how they really feel about each other.~~ **Later both of them admitted that they've never liked each over.**[1.](#1.5ch)
In the light novel of Volume 4, despite being promised to protect Karuizawa from being bullied by Manabe and her group, Yōsuke doesn't want to take a side and want to discuss it peacefully without using violence against someone. He did offer his help to her, **but he couldn't hurt someone even if it was somebody from class 1-C.** ~~but since he's not her real boyfriend, he didn't need to go that far for her.~~[2](#2ch) So he tells her that he won't help her **if she wants to rely on violence** ~~she won't be able to depend on him if there's nothing he can do for her.~~[3](#3ch) 

__Yosuke's side__

Yōsuke seems to have close a relationship with Kei as when school first started, she cheered on his idea of the class introducing themselves. After several days of school, they seem to have become a couple or at least formed a bond as they are often seen together.

~~In truth, they're just pretending to be in a relationship so that Kei would not get bullied in school so it is unknown how they really feel about each other.~~[3](#1ch) ~~However, it shown he does care for her as~~ When Kei's underwear is stolen, Yōsuke searches the boys for them though he covers for Kiyotaka after finding them on him; he asks for the panties as he will suffer less being Kei's "boyfriend".

In return, she seems to trust him as she selected him to be part of the guards for the boys after the girls demanded the boys being separated from the girls. This was seen again as she defended him when Suzune hinted that he could possibly do mischievous activities while acting as a guard. However, she did see Suzune's point and went along with the latter's decision to make Kiyotaka a guard as well to keep an eye on Yōsuke.

#### Suzune Horikita B

They don't have much interaction but don't appear on good terms.

In episode 7, she was rather callous to her and told Yōsuke they should go.

During the survival test, after Yōsuke is chosen by Kei to watch over the boys in the class, Suzune steps in. She doesn't oppose Kei's request of watching the boys but requested another boy join him on guard duty since he needed to be watched as well. After Kei mentions there was no other boy who seemed trustworthy, Suzune selected Kiyotaka.

__Suzune's side__

[Return to content](#content)

#### Kiyotaka Ayanokoji B
During the survival test, when Yōsuke is chosen to watch over the boys in the class, Suzune requested Kiyotaka join him on guard duty since he needed to be watched as well. While he is picked, Kei notes on him being invisible to the rest of the class, showing that she barely acknowledges his presence in their time as classmates.

Due to his real thoughts, it is unknown what he really thinks of her.

__Spoilers__

Much like the anime, Kei initially did not think much of Kiyotaka. She often looked down on him for being an "unremarkable guy" and appeared disgusted by his presence when they were both placed in the "Rabbit" group during the summer special test, although she shared the same feelings about her other groupmates, Hideo and Teruhiko, so it wasn't personal.

After being saved from Manabe and her group during the cruise ship test, she starts to hold a dislike towards Kiyotaka, unable to look at him without an angry expression and was mad when Hirata arranged a meeting with her but brought Kiyotaka with him. After being bullied by Manabe and her group in an isolated ward, she was blackmailed by Kiyotaka and threatened her that he'll reveal her past to the school, but assured her that he'll protect her from being bullied in exchange for aiding him on his scheme. 

She was amazed at his true physical abilities at the sports festival after he raced Manabu Horikita and nearly won. She seems to have formed a friendship with him which evolves into a close trusting bond with him, where Kiyotaka is shown to truly trust her more so than others, even more than Suzune and in volume 6 of the light novel, it seems that she develops a crush on Kiyotaka. Her crush on him was also hinted further in the light novel when she became jealous of Maya's flirtation with Kiyotaka. Kei is one of the people who refer Kiyotaka on the first-name basis. She was also the first person to celebrate his birthday, causing him to hesitate on deleting her text messages, which he usually does. He also learned of her birthday and decided to do the same for her.

In Volume 7, even though she learned from Kakeru Ryūen that Kiyotaka betrayed her by using her from the very beginning, she still refused to betray Kiyotaka, calling him her hero, as she refused to tell Kakeru Ryūen that Kiyotaka is the true mastermind of Class D. However, she was surprised to see Kiyotaka beating up Ryūen's gang, and angrily attack Ryūen for threatening her. She was shaken by his abilities but hugged him as she was relieved that he came to her aid as he mentioned his promise to protect her.

__Kiyotaka's side__

During the survival test, when Suzune selected Kiyotaka to serve as a guard along with Yōsuke Hirata to watch over the boys in the class, she noted on him being invisible to the rest of the class. Kei agreed with Suzune as he didn't seem lecherous to her, which seem to indicate that she doesn't take too much notice of him.
Due to his monologue at the end of the anime, it is unknown what he thinks of her.

__Spoilers__

In the light novels, their relationship is much more complex than it is in the anime.

Much like the anime, Kei initially did not think much of Kiyotaka. She often looked down on him for being an "unremarkable guy" despite not having anything personal against him. After he and Yukimura overhear Manabe and her group bullying her, she starts to hold a dislike towards him, unable to look at him without an angry expression and was mad when Hirata arranged a meeting with her but brought Kiyotaka with him.

It was soon discovered from Hirata that her condescending attitude is a facade she maintains to hide her true self. He explains that Kei has been a victim of bullying for the past nine years since she was little and also revealed about the fake relationship between her and Hirata. After learning about Kei's past, he set up Manabe and her group to bully Kei in an isolated ward,then he blackmailed her,but promised that he'll protect her from being bullied in exchange for aiding him in his schemes.

Afterwards, he seemed to form a very close trusting bond with her, where Kiyotaka is shown to trust her more so than others, even more than Suzune. In volume 6 of the light novel, it appears that she has developed a crush on Kiyotaka. Her crush on him was hinted further in the light novel when she became jealous of Maya's flirtations with Kiyotaka. Kei is one of the few people who refer to Kiyotaka by his first name. She was also the first person to celebrate his birthday, causing him to hesitate on deleting her text messages, which he usually does. He also learned of her birthday and decided to do the same for her.

In Volume 7, Kiyotaka decided to cut ties with Kei after he lost a reason to reach A-Class after he turned out to hold no control over him. In spite of this, Kiyotaka soon changed his mind and considered Kei as an efficient and valuable pawn after saving her, but in truth, her usefulness or not is a secondary concern for him as all that's important to him is that she remained to be his.

Despite this view of her, he appears to genuinely care for her as he protected her by violently attacking Kakeru and defeated him with ease through sheer strength and intense fear for threatening her. His actions surprised Kei as she watched him easily take down C-Class. She was shaken by his true abilities but hugged him as she was relieved that he came to her aid as he mentioned his promise to protect her.

In volume 11.5, Kei sees Kiyotaka and Hiyori Shiina going on a date and becomes jealous. She is also jealous that Kiyotaka has the same hobby as Hiyori.

In the epilogue of volume 11.5, Kiyotaka declares his love for her and she accepts.

Hirata's feeling

Volume 11.5 Chapter 1:

```
“So you’re saying that you’ve never liked a girl before? Even now?”

“Yeah...”

```

Kei's feeling

##### 2ch

Hirata is type of guy who will help his classmates. He just doesn't like conflicts.

Volume 4 Chapter 4:
```
“It doesn’t matter what the reason is. I can’t do what you want. You’re one of my classmates, Karuizawa-san. If you’re in trouble, I’ll help you, protect you. But I can’t hurt someone else to do that, even if they’re from Class C,” he said.
```

Hirata's never said that she can't depend on him anymore

Volume 4 Chapter 4:

```
“That’s not what I’m saying. I’ll do what I can to help you. When morning comes, I intend to speak with Manabe-san and her friends. I’ll tell them to stop harassing you, Karuizawa-san. You probably won’t like this, but I’ll tell them that you’ll apologize.”
“I don’t want to!” Karuizawa had come to Hirata in order to take revenge on Manabe and her friends, and that spoke to her true personality— her real self. More than anything else, Karuizawa was afraid.
“If that’s the case, then I can’t help you. I’m sorry.” Hirata was calm. Even now, he was composed. But he was also extremely reliable, and for someone like Karuizawa who needed that reliability, losing it was basically a death sentence.
...
“Whatever! If you’re not going to listen to me, then I don’t need you!” Karuizawa threw the can of juice she was holding down the hall. The contents spilled all over the place, and the sound echoed down the hall. “Our relationship is over. 
"It’s over!” she shouted.
```
