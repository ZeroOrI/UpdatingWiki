#### Basic A

> In the end, even after I entered this school. Nothing had changed. No, perhaps it was that I had no intention of changing anything from the start. For better or for worse, it was the same as that time. The reason for that was very simple. ... Because I myself wanted this. "

Kei Karuizawa (軽かる井い沢ざわ 恵けい, Karuizawa Kei) is a student of Class 2-D. She sits in the second row, the second seat from the left, next to Yōsuke Hirata, the class's representative.

[Return to content](#content)

#### Background A
She is a prominent figure of class. Being gifted with an attractive personality, she is considered to be the girl's leader of class D. Her development in the story is worth reading. Despite her looks and attitude she displays and the relationship between her and Hirata, she has her bunch of secrets that she cannot afford to reveal to others.

#### Appearance A
Kei is a teenage girl of average height with waist-length blonde hair that is tied in a ponytail and purple eyes. Her school uniform consists of a light blue dress shirt below the red school blazer with rolled-up sleeves and a short white skirt. She walks in standard school shoes with light blue calf-length socks. She predominantly wears a blue ribbon around her collar. In a more casual situation, she simply wraps her school blazer around her waist and rolls up her dress shirt sleeves.

[Return to content](#content)

#### Personality A
Kei is an outgoing person who spends most of her time with the girls at school and Yōsuke Hirata (her boyfriend). Typically she speaks for the girls in the class, acting as one of the leaders along with Yōsuke and eventually Suzune Horikita.

She seems to be a bit of a mooch, as after spending all her points from the first month and D-Class not receiving any, due to their penalties, she asked the girls of her class to lend her some money to buy the 'essentials', managing to gain at least 2000 points from Kikyō Kushida.

She doesn't take notice of less prominent people in the class. This was seen when she mentioned Kiyotaka Ayanokōji being "invisible" after Suzune nominated him as a guard with Yōsuke. Ironically, she befriended him in the light novels and they were very close, even being impressed by his abilities and going on a first name basis as she eventually starts to develop romantic feelings for him.

__Spoilers__ 

In volume 4 of the LN's, it was revealed that in her earlier years Kei was bullied in school, resulting in a physical scar and a lingering mental scar. To help prevent this happening again at her new high school, she started going out with Yōsuke Hirata, the most popular guy in class. This gave her a sense of security to just be herself without worrying about being targeted for abuse. Although this wasn't a genuine relationship, Yōsuke did know about the circumstances and went along with it to protect Kei.

#### Abilities A
Kei was assessed as being subpar by the school. Her absences and grades in middle school were direct reasons for her being placed in D-Class. She doesn't like academics nor sports but is surprisingly able to compete with others. She has immense mental strength, according to both Kiyotaka and Kakeru.

#### Plot A
In the anime, Kei, like the other first years, listened to the speech given by Manabu Horikita, welcoming the first years to their new school. She was seen in the class talking to Satsuki Shinohara before Yōsuke Hirata asked the class to introduce themselves, agreeing with the idea.[1](#original-1)

After the teacher Sae Chabashira walked in and introduced to the class the system in which they are supposed to live in now, Kei was surprised at the fact that they received 100,000 private points, to begin with. She was seen talking with Maya Satō and Chiaki Matsushita about clothes and jewelry shopping after the classes that day. At the start of the new month of June, along with the rest of D-Class, Kei was shocked when Class D did not receive the monthly allotment of points, looking depressed throughout the explanation of S-Points and the reason D-Class didn't get any points.[1](#original-1)

At some point later, Kei went to the pool with the rest of the class, getting especially close to Yōsuke, which possibly indicates that they have been dating since. She tried asking Kikyō to lend her points along with some other girls of the class to buy herself the 'essentials', in which at least Kikyō complied with the demand. She is seen getting closer to Yōsuke, then proceeding to take the mid-test exams and passing with an overall score of 75.[2](#original-2)

During the anime pool filler episode, Kei saw Suzune walking out of the apartment building, claiming how there were rumors she had died, since no one had seen her over the summer break. Kei then left, dragging Yōsuke with her after Suzune expressed her disinterest in hanging out with the rest of her class when being questioned about it.[3](#original-3)

Later Kei, like all the other first years, took part in the school cruise, where she was seen calling Yōsuke over to hang out with her friends.[4](#original-4) When the cruise ship headed to an island, all first-year students were told they need to survive for more than a week with basic materials. Kei got into an argument with Teruhiko Yukimura about the hygienic materials they would need for survival, specifically the need for a toilet. Kanji Ike joined the argument as well, but after setting up camp, he surprised Kei, as he apologized for his words since he went through a similar event when camping as a child. Touched by this, Kei apologized for not understanding his reasons as well.[5](#original-5)

Towards the end of the survival test week, Kei was found crying in the girl's tent as her underwear was apparently stolen. The girls of her class had Yōsuke check all the boys and their luggage to find it. After minutes of searching, Yōsuke then found the underwear in Kiyotaka Ayanokōji's luggage but refrained from telling anyone, since he (rightfully) suspected that Ayanokōji was set up by someone else.[6](#original-6)

The next day, Kei and the other girls told the boys to build a separate camp from them because of the incident the day before. Kei had Yōsuke watch over the boys in the class while they moved, but Suzune requested that another boy should check over Yōsuke, since he could potentially be a threat as well. Though Kei defended her boyfriend, she agreed to the request but wondered which boy should help as all the other boys are deemed untrustworthy. Suzune then proposed that Kiyotaka be the second guard since he doesn't seem to have a lecherous side.

Kei recalled that Kiyotaka was often 'invisible' during class, admitting to herself that she barely noticed him being their classmate. In the same night, somebody had started a fire at camp by burning the survival test manual, Kei and the other girls questioned the culprit's identity, first suspecting that one of the boys must have done it. They soon, however, suspected Mio Ibuki because of she was nowhere to be found during the incident. They later learned that Suzune had dropped out of the test because of a fever. They then discussed Mio's motive and whether or not she was the actual culprit and C-Class' leader since her class had dropped out of the test earlier in the week.[7](#original-7)

The next morning, Kei was seen cleaning in the camp along with the girls. At the time of the class points announcement, she and the entire class were shocked to hear that D-Class came in the first place. Later that same day on the cruise ship, Kei and the others thanked Suzune for her brilliant plan, though, unbeknown to them that Kiyotaka actually planned everything but gave Suzune all the credit to boost her popularity in the class cementing her place as a dependable leader.[8](#original-8)

__Spoilers__
In the light novel, there was another exam on the ship after their return from the survival island. In this exam, their objective was to find a traitor hidden among the groups that were divided into 12 different groups based on the Chinese zodiac's names among all classes. Kei was put into the same group as Kiyotaka, Teruhiko Yukimura, Hideo Sotomura, and students from other classes such as Honami Ichinose from B-Class, Machida from A-Class, and Mio Ibuki and Shiho Manabe from C-Class. Kei couldn't hide her dissatisfaction when seeing Kiyotaka and others as her groupmates.[9](#original)

Kei was seen not taking part in the group discussions to expose the traitor, but she was often seen flirting with the handsome Machida from the A-Class, which eventually pissed off Manabe and her C class friends. Machida seems to taken interest in Kei due to her cuteness and he had shown a protective behavior toward Kei. Manabe and her friends then brought up the topic of how Kei shoved one of her friends, Rika, and asked for her apology. Kei then feigned ignorance and kept using Machida as a shield, which further pissed Manabe off.

After one of their group meetings, Kiyotaka and Teruhiko saw Kei getting dragged into the emergency stairs and getting confronted by Manabe and others. Manabe was still confronting Kei about the incident that happened to Rika, but Kei was being stubborn and neglected the fact that she pushed Rika. As the argument got heated up, Manabe and others lost their patience and started making physical contact with Kei. Though they began by shoving her shoulder, even this caused Kei to show strange symptoms for her, breathing raggedly and curling into a fetal position. Manabe and her friends then proceeded to grab Kei's hair and forcefully pulled Kei up, and saying that they wanted to hit Kei's face. This act of physical bullying really caused Kei to lose her previous arrogance and attitude, causing her to begin to shake and tear up to the point where the previous Karuizawa Kei seemed nothing more than a façade. Before the situation could turn even worse, Teruhiko, who couldn’t bear to watch it anymore, came to interrupt them. The situation did not get better until Kiyotaka said that he saw a teacher and said it was better for them to leave. Manabe and others left, and Kei recovered. She then brushed off Teruhiko, who showed concerns, and told him and Kiyotaka not to let anyone know about this.

Kiyotaka thought that Kei's reactions were too extreme, so he asked Hirata and learned about that Kei had been bullied since elementary school. As he learned that Kei was a capable person who could cover up her past using a new persona up until now, he decided to make her his pawn who would secretly completely obey his orders. He anonymously testified to Manabe about their issue, then used Hirata's phone to lure Kei to the ship's basement near the engine room and let Manabe's group get revenge for their friend. After Manabe's group left, he approached Kei and told her that he would save her in exchange for her obeying all orders. Kei tried to put up a strong front, but lost all will to resist when Kiyotaka glared deeply into her eye. He secretly took a video of Manabe bullying Kei at the staircase, which he used to save Kei by blackmailing Manabe's group into not approaching Kei or saying anything about Kei. Finally forming a relationship with Kei, he firstly made her go along with his plan, making A-class wrongly guess the group traitor.

Seriously, seriously, seriously, my heart's seriously been stolen away. The arrow which had pierced my heart. The arrow of love which I could no longer take out. Is this even possible?

### Relationships A

[Go to changes](#relationships-b)

[Return to content](#content)

#### Yosuke Hirata A
She seems to have a close relationship with Yōsuke as when the school first started she cheered on his idea of the class introducing themselves.

After several days of school, they seem to have formed a bond as they are often seen together. In truth, they're just pretending to be in a relationship in order for Kei to not get bullied in school so it is unknown how they really feel about each other.

__Spoilers__

In the light novel of Volume 4, despite being promised to protect Karuizawa from being bullied by Manabe and her group, Yōsuke doesn't want to take a side and want to discuss it peacefully without using violence against someone. He did offer his help to her, but since he's not her real boyfriend, he didn't need to go that far for her. He also tells her that he won't help her like this and she won't be able to depend on him if there's nothing he can do for her.[1](#reference-1)

__Yosuke's side__

Yōsuke seems to have close a relationship with Kei as when school first started, she cheered on his idea of the class introducing themselves. After several days of school, they seem to have become a couple or at least formed a bond as they are often seen together.

In truth, they're just pretending to be in a relationship so that Kei would not get bullied in school so it is unknown how they really feel about each other. However, it shown he does care for her as when Kei's underwear is stolen, Yōsuke searches the boys for them though he covers for Kiyotaka after finding them on him; he asks for the panties as he will suffer less being Kei's "boyfriend".

In return, she seems to trust him as she selected him to be part of the guards for the boys after the girls demanded the boys being separated from the girls. This was seen again as she defended him when Suzune hinted that he could possibly do mischievous activities while acting as a guard. However, she did see Suzune's point and went along with the latter's decision to make Kiyotaka a guard as well to keep an eye on Yōsuke.

In the light novel of Volume 4, despite being promised to protect Karuizawa from being bullied by Manabe and her group, Yōsuke doesn't want to take a side and want to discuss it peacefully without using violence against someone. He did offer his help to her, but since he's not her real boyfriend, he didn't need to go that far for her.

#### Suzune Horikita A

They don't have much interaction but don't appear on good terms.

In episode 7, she was rather callous to her and told Yōsuke they should go.

During the survival test, after Yōsuke is chosen by Kei to watch over the boys in the class, Suzune steps in. She doesn't oppose Kei's request of watching the boys but requested another boy join him on guard duty since he needed to be watched as well. After Kei mentions there was no other boy who seemed trustworthy, Suzune selected Kiyotaka.

__Suzune's side__

#### Kiyotaka Ayanokoji A

During the survival test, when Yōsuke is chosen to watch over the boys in the class, Suzune requested Kiyotaka join him on guard duty since he needed to be watched as well. While he is picked, Kei notes on him being invisible to the rest of the class, showing that she barely acknowledges his presence in their time as classmates.

Due to his real thoughts, it is unknown what he really thinks of her.

__Spoilers__

Much like the anime, Kei initially did not think much of Kiyotaka. She often looked down on him for being an "unremarkable guy" and appeared disgusted by his presence when they were both placed in the "Rabbit" group during the summer special test, although she shared the same feelings about her other groupmates, Hideo and Teruhiko, so it wasn't personal.

After being saved from Manabe and her group during the cruise ship test, she starts to hold a dislike towards Kiyotaka, unable to look at him without an angry expression and was mad when Hirata arranged a meeting with her but brought Kiyotaka with him. After being bullied by Manabe and her group in an isolated ward, she was blackmailed by Kiyotaka and threatened her that he'll reveal her past to the school, but assured her that he'll protect her from being bullied in exchange for aiding him on his scheme. [1](#reference-1])

She was amazed at his true physical abilities at the sports festival after he raced Manabu Horikita and nearly won.[2](#reference-2) She seems to have formed a friendship with him which evolves into a close trusting bond with him, where Kiyotaka is shown to truly trust her more so than others, even more than Suzune and in volume 6 of the light novel, it seems that she develops a crush on Kiyotaka. Her crush on him was also hinted further in the light novel when she became jealous of Maya's flirtation with Kiyotaka. Kei is one of the people who refer Kiyotaka on the first-name basis. She was also the first person to celebrate his birthday, causing him to hesitate on deleting her text messages, which he usually does. He also learned of her birthday and decided to do the same for her.[3](#reference-3)

In Volume 7, even though she learned from Kakeru Ryūen that Kiyotaka betrayed her by using her from the very beginning, she still refused to betray Kiyotaka, calling him her hero, as she refused to tell Kakeru Ryūen that Kiyotaka is the true mastermind of Class D. However, she was surprised to see Kiyotaka beating up Ryūen's gang, and angrily attack Ryūen for threatening her. She was shaken by his abilities but hugged him as she was relieved that he came to her aid as he mentioned his promise to protect her.[4](#reference-4)

In her monologue in volume 7.5, she admits that she has fallen in love with him.[5](#reference-5)

In volume 11.5, Kei sees Kiyotaka and Hiyori Shiina going on a date and becomes jealous. She is also jealous that Kiyotaka has the same hobby as Hiyori.

In the epilogue of volume 11.5, Kiyotaka declares his love for her and she accepts.

__Kiyotaka's side__

During the survival test, when Suzune selected Kiyotaka to serve as a guard along with Yōsuke Hirata to watch over the boys in the class, she noted on him being invisible to the rest of the class. Kei agreed with Suzune as he didn't seem lecherous to her, which seem to indicate that she doesn't take too much notice of him.
Due to his monologue at the end of the anime, it is unknown what he thinks of her.

__Spoilers__

In the light novels, their relationship is much more complex than it is in the anime.

Much like the anime, Kei initially did not think much of Kiyotaka. She often looked down on him for being an "unremarkable guy" despite not having anything personal against him. After he and Yukimura overhear Manabe and her group bullying her, she starts to hold a dislike towards him, unable to look at him without an angry expression and was mad when Hirata arranged a meeting with her but brought Kiyotaka with him.

It was soon discovered from Hirata that her condescending attitude is a facade she maintains to hide her true self. He explains that Kei has been a victim of bullying for the past nine years since she was little and also revealed about the fake relationship between her and Hirata. After learning about Kei's past, he set up Manabe and her group to bully Kei in an isolated ward,then he blackmailed her,but promised that he'll protect her from being bullied in exchange for aiding him in his schemes.

Afterwards, he seemed to form a very close trusting bond with her, where Kiyotaka is shown to trust her more so than others, even more than Suzune. In volume 6 of the light novel, it appears that she has developed a crush on Kiyotaka. Her crush on him was hinted further in the light novel when she became jealous of Maya's flirtations with Kiyotaka. Kei is one of the few people who refer to Kiyotaka by his first name. She was also the first person to celebrate his birthday, causing him to hesitate on deleting her text messages, which he usually does. He also learned of her birthday and decided to do the same for her.

In Volume 7, Kiyotaka decided to cut ties with Kei after he lost a reason to reach A-Class after he turned out to hold no control over him. In spite of this, Kiyotaka soon changed his mind and considered Kei as an efficient and valuable pawn after saving her, but in truth, her usefulness or not is a secondary concern for him as all that's important to him is that she remained to be his.

Despite this view of her, he appears to genuinely care for her as he protected her by violently attacking Kakeru and defeated him with ease through sheer strength and intense fear for threatening her. His actions surprised Kei as she watched him easily take down C-Class. She was shaken by his true abilities but hugged him as she was relieved that he came to her aid as he mentioned his promise to protect her.

In volume 11.5, Kei sees Kiyotaka and Hiyori Shiina going on a date and becomes jealous. She is also jealous that Kiyotaka has the same hobby as Hiyori.

In the epilogue of volume 11.5, Kiyotaka declares his love for her and she accepts.

#### Personality B

Kei is an outgoing person who spends most of her time with the girls at school and her boyfriend Yōsuke Hirata . __Even though she pretended to be nice in front of Hirata, she was domineering with other ladies.__ [5.5](#5.5change) __Karuizawa is very self-centered person, who won't care about feelings of other.__[5.75](#5.75change)

She seems to be a bit of a mooch, as after spending all her points from the first month and D-Class not receiving any, due to their penalties, she asked the girls of her class to lend her some money to buy the 'essentials', managing to gain at least 2000 points from Kikyō Kushida.

She doesn't take notice of less prominent people in the class. This was seen when she mentioned Kiyotaka Ayanokōji being "invisible" after Suzune nominated him as a guard with Yōsuke. ~~Ironically, she befriended him in the light novels and they were very close, even being impressed by his abilities and going on a first name basis as she eventually starts to develop romantic feelings for him.~~[6](#6change).

__Spoilers__ 

In volume 4 of the LN's, it was revealed that in her earlier years Kei was bullied in school, resulting in a physical scar and a lingering mental scar. To help prevent this happening again at her new high school, she started going out with Yōsuke Hirata, the most popular guy in class. __Even if she was scared that Hirata could betray her, she didn't have a choice and tried this.__  This gave her a sense of security to just be herself without worrying about being targeted for abuse. Although this wasn't a genuine relationship, Yōsuke did know about the circumstances and went along with it to protect Kei.
__All her personality that she's shown previously was only an image to protect herself. She thinks of herself as parasite who can't survive on its own. But with flow a time she builds her new self, and finally accepts herself.__

#### Plot B

~~**PLOT**~~
**Anime**

In the anime, Kei, like the other first years, listened to the speech given by Manabu Horikita, welcoming the first years to their new school. She was seen in the class talking to Satsuki Shinohara before Yōsuke Hirata asked the class to introduce themselves, agreeing with the idea.

After the teacher Sae Chabashira walked in and introduced to the class the system in which they are supposed to live in now, Kei was surprised at the fact that they received 100,000 private points, to begin with. She was seen talking with Maya Satō and Chiaki Matsushita about clothes and jewelry shopping after the classes that day. At the start of the new month of June, along with the rest of D-Class, Kei was shocked when Class D did not receive the monthly allotment of points, looking depressed throughout the explanation of S-Points and the reason D-Class didn't get any points.

At some point later, Kei went to the pool with the rest of the class, getting especially close to Yōsuke, which possibly indicates that they have been dating since. She tried asking Kikyō to lend her points along with some other girls of the class to buy herself the 'essentials', in which at least Kikyō complied with the demand. She is seen getting closer to Yōsuke, then proceeding to take the mid-test exams and passing with an overall score of 75.

During the anime pool filler episode, Kei saw Suzune walking out of the apartment building, claiming how there were rumors she had died, since no one had seen her over the summer break. Kei then left, dragging Yōsuke with her after Suzune expressed her disinterest in hanging out with the rest of her class when being questioned about it.

Later Kei, like all the other first years, took part in the school cruise, where she was seen calling Yōsuke over to hang out with her friends. When the cruise ship headed to an island, all first-year students were told they need to survive for more than a week with basic materials. Kei got into an argument with Teruhiko Yukimura about the hygienic materials they would need for survival, specifically the need for a toilet. Kanji Ike joined the argument as well, but after setting up camp, he surprised Kei, as he apologized for his words since he went through a similar event when camping as a child. Touched by this, Kei apologized for not understanding his reasons as well.

Towards the end of the survival test week, Kei was found crying in the girl's tent as her underwear was apparently stolen. The girls of her class had Yōsuke check all the boys and their luggage to find it. After minutes of searching, Yōsuke then found the underwear in Kiyotaka Ayanokōji's luggage but refrained from telling anyone, since he (rightfully) suspected that Ayanokōji was set up by someone else.

The next day, Kei and the other girls told the boys to build a separate camp from them because of the incident the day before. Kei had Yōsuke watch over the boys in the class while they moved, but Suzune requested that another boy should check over Yōsuke, since he could potentially be a threat as well. Though Kei defended her boyfriend, she agreed to the request but wondered which boy should help as all the other boys are deemed untrustworthy. Suzune then proposed that Kiyotaka be the second guard since he doesn't seem to have a lecherous side.

Kei recalled that Kiyotaka was often 'invisible' during class, admitting to herself that she barely noticed him being their classmate. In the same night, somebody had started a fire at camp by burning the survival test manual, Kei and the other girls questioned the culprit's identity, first suspecting that one of the boys must have done it. They soon, however, suspected Mio Ibuki because of she was nowhere to be found during the incident. They later learned that Suzune had dropped out of the test because of a fever. They then discussed Mio's motive and whether or not she was the actual culprit and C-Class' leader since her class had dropped out of the test earlier in the week.

The next morning, Kei was seen cleaning in the camp along with the girls. At the time of the class points announcement, she and the entire class were shocked to hear that D-Class came in the first place. Later that same day on the cruise ship, Kei and the others thanked Suzune for her brilliant plan, though, unbeknown to them that Kiyotaka actually planned everything but gave Suzune all the credit to boost her popularity in the class cementing her place as a dependable leader.

================================================================================================

**new section**

**LN Plot**

__Spoilers__
There was another exam on the ship after their return from the survival island. In this exam, their objective was to find a traitor hidden among the groups that were divided into 12 different groups based on the Chinese zodiac's names among all classes. Kei was put into the same group as Kiyotaka, Teruhiko Yukimura, Hideo Sotomura, and students from other classes such as Honami Ichinose from B-Class, Machida from A-Class, and Mio Ibuki and Shiho Manabe from C-Class. Kei couldn't hide her dissatisfaction when seeing Kiyotaka and others as her groupmates.

Kei was seen not taking part in the group discussions to expose the traitor, but she was often seen flirting with the handsome Machida from the A-Class, which eventually pissed off Manabe and her C class friends. Machida seems to taken interest in Kei due to her cuteness and he had shown a protective behavior toward Kei. Manabe and her friends then brought up the topic of how Kei shoved one of her friends, Rika, and asked for her apology. Kei then feigned ignorance and kept using Machida as a shield, which further pissed Manabe off.

After one of their group meetings, Kiyotaka and Teruhiko saw Kei getting dragged into the emergency stairs and getting confronted by Manabe and others. Manabe was still confronting Kei about the incident that happened to Rika, but Kei was being stubborn and neglected the fact that she pushed Rika. As the argument got heated up, Manabe and others lost their patience and started making physical contact with Kei. Though they began by shoving her shoulder, even this caused Kei to show strange symptoms for her, breathing raggedly and curling into a fetal position. Manabe and her friends then proceeded to grab Kei's hair and forcefully pulled Kei up, and saying that they wanted to hit Kei's face. This act of physical bullying really caused Kei to lose her previous arrogance and attitude, causing her to begin to shake and tear up to the point where the previous Karuizawa Kei seemed nothing more than a façade. Before the situation could turn even worse, Teruhiko, who couldn’t bear to watch it anymore, came to interrupt them. The situation did not get better until Kiyotaka said that he saw a teacher and said it was better for them to leave. Manabe and others left, and Kei recovered. She then brushed off Teruhiko, who showed concerns, and told him and Kiyotaka not to let anyone know about this.

Kiyotaka thought that Kei's reactions were too extreme, so he asked Hirata and learned about that Kei had been bullied since elementary school. As he learned that Kei was a capable person who could cover up her past using a new persona up until now, he decided to make her his pawn who would secretly completely obey his orders. He anonymously testified to Manabe about their issue, then used Hirata's phone to lure Kei to the ship's basement near the engine room and let Manabe's group get revenge for their friend. After Manabe's group left, he approached Kei and told her that he would save her in exchange for her obeying all orders. Kei tried to put up a strong front, but lost all will to resist when Kiyotaka glared deeply into her eye. He secretly took a video of Manabe bullying Kei at the staircase, which he used to save Kei by blackmailing Manabe's group into not approaching Kei or saying anything about Kei. Finally forming a relationship with Kei, he firstly made her go along with his plan, making A-class wrongly guess the group traitor.

Seriously, seriously, seriously, my heart's seriously been stolen away. The arrow which had pierced my heart. The arrow of love which I could no longer take out. Is this even possible? Is it even fine for me to fall in love with someone who's been partly bullying me? But it's already too late. The power of this arrow is tremendous.

### Relationships B

[Return to content](#content)

#### Yosuke Hirata B

She seems to have a close relationship with Yōsuke as when the school first started she cheered on his idea of the class introducing themselves.

After several days of school, they seem to have formed a bond as they are often seen together. In truth, they're just pretending to be in a relationship in order for Kei to not get bullied in school so it is unknown how they really feel about each other.

__Spoilers__

In the light novel of Volume 4, despite being promised to protect Karuizawa from being bullied by Manabe and her group, Yōsuke doesn't want to take a side and want to discuss it peacefully without using violence against someone. He did offer his help to her, but since he's not her real boyfriend, he didn't need to go that far for her. He also tells her that he won't help her like this and she won't be able to depend on him if there's nothing he can do for her.

__Yosuke's side__

Yōsuke seems to have close a relationship with Kei as when school first started, she cheered on his idea of the class introducing themselves. After several days of school, they seem to have become a couple or at least formed a bond as they are often seen together.

In truth, they're just pretending to be in a relationship so that Kei would not get bullied in school so it is unknown how they really feel about each other. However, it shown he does care for her as when Kei's underwear is stolen, Yōsuke searches the boys for them though he covers for Kiyotaka after finding them on him; he asks for the panties as he will suffer less being Kei's "boyfriend".

In return, she seems to trust him as she selected him to be part of the guards for the boys after the girls demanded the boys being separated from the girls. This was seen again as she defended him when Suzune hinted that he could possibly do mischievous activities while acting as a guard. However, she did see Suzune's point and went along with the latter's decision to make Kiyotaka a guard as well to keep an eye on Yōsuke.

In the light novel of Volume 4, despite being promised to protect Karuizawa from being bullied by Manabe and her group, Yōsuke doesn't want to take a side and want to discuss it peacefully without using violence against someone. He did offer his help to her, but since he's not her real boyfriend, he didn't need to go that far for her.

#### Suzune Horikita B

They don't have much interaction but don't appear on good terms.

In episode 7, she was rather callous to her and told Yōsuke they should go.

During the survival test, after Yōsuke is chosen by Kei to watch over the boys in the class, Suzune steps in. She doesn't oppose Kei's request of watching the boys but requested another boy join him on guard duty since he needed to be watched as well. After Kei mentions there was no other boy who seemed trustworthy, Suzune selected Kiyotaka.

__Suzune's side__

[Return to content](#content)

#### Kiyotaka Ayanokoji B
During the survival test, when Yōsuke is chosen to watch over the boys in the class, Suzune requested Kiyotaka join him on guard duty since he needed to be watched as well. While he is picked, Kei notes on him being invisible to the rest of the class, showing that she barely acknowledges his presence in their time as classmates.

Due to his real thoughts, it is unknown what he really thinks of her.

__Spoilers__

Much like the anime, Kei initially did not think much of Kiyotaka. She often looked down on him for being an "unremarkable guy" and appeared disgusted by his presence when they were both placed in the "Rabbit" group during the summer special test, although she shared the same feelings about her other groupmates, Hideo and Teruhiko, so it wasn't personal.

After being saved from Manabe and her group during the cruise ship test, she starts to hold a dislike towards Kiyotaka, unable to look at him without an angry expression and was mad when Hirata arranged a meeting with her but brought Kiyotaka with him. After being bullied by Manabe and her group in an isolated ward, she was blackmailed by Kiyotaka and threatened her that he'll reveal her past to the school, but assured her that he'll protect her from being bullied in exchange for aiding him on his scheme. 

She was amazed at his true physical abilities at the sports festival after he raced Manabu Horikita and nearly won. She seems to have formed a friendship with him which evolves into a close trusting bond with him, where Kiyotaka is shown to truly trust her more so than others, even more than Suzune and in volume 6 of the light novel, it seems that she develops a crush on Kiyotaka. Her crush on him was also hinted further in the light novel when she became jealous of Maya's flirtation with Kiyotaka. Kei is one of the people who refer Kiyotaka on the first-name basis. She was also the first person to celebrate his birthday, causing him to hesitate on deleting her text messages, which he usually does. He also learned of her birthday and decided to do the same for her.

In Volume 7, even though she learned from Kakeru Ryūen that Kiyotaka betrayed her by using her from the very beginning, she still refused to betray Kiyotaka, calling him her hero, as she refused to tell Kakeru Ryūen that Kiyotaka is the true mastermind of Class D. However, she was surprised to see Kiyotaka beating up Ryūen's gang, and angrily attack Ryūen for threatening her. She was shaken by his abilities but hugged him as she was relieved that he came to her aid as he mentioned his promise to protect her.

In her monologue in volume 7.5, she admits that she has fallen in love with him.

In volume 11.5, Kei sees Kiyotaka and Hiyori Shiina going on a date and becomes jealous. She is also jealous that Kiyotaka has the same hobby as Hiyori.

In the epilogue of volume 11.5, Kiyotaka declares his love for her and she accepts.

__Kiyotaka's side__

During the survival test, when Suzune selected Kiyotaka to serve as a guard along with Yōsuke Hirata to watch over the boys in the class, she noted on him being invisible to the rest of the class. Kei agreed with Suzune as he didn't seem lecherous to her, which seem to indicate that she doesn't take too much notice of him.
Due to his monologue at the end of the anime, it is unknown what he thinks of her.

__Spoilers__

In the light novels, their relationship is much more complex than it is in the anime.

Much like the anime, Kei initially did not think much of Kiyotaka. She often looked down on him for being an "unremarkable guy" despite not having anything personal against him. After he and Yukimura overhear Manabe and her group bullying her, she starts to hold a dislike towards him, unable to look at him without an angry expression and was mad when Hirata arranged a meeting with her but brought Kiyotaka with him.

It was soon discovered from Hirata that her condescending attitude is a facade she maintains to hide her true self. He explains that Kei has been a victim of bullying for the past nine years since she was little and also revealed about the fake relationship between her and Hirata. After learning about Kei's past, he set up Manabe and her group to bully Kei in an isolated ward,then he blackmailed her,but promised that he'll protect her from being bullied in exchange for aiding him in his schemes.

Afterwards, he seemed to form a very close trusting bond with her, where Kiyotaka is shown to trust her more so than others, even more than Suzune. In volume 6 of the light novel, it appears that she has developed a crush on Kiyotaka. Her crush on him was hinted further in the light novel when she became jealous of Maya's flirtations with Kiyotaka. Kei is one of the few people who refer to Kiyotaka by his first name. She was also the first person to celebrate his birthday, causing him to hesitate on deleting her text messages, which he usually does. He also learned of her birthday and decided to do the same for her.

In Volume 7, Kiyotaka decided to cut ties with Kei after he lost a reason to reach A-Class after he turned out to hold no control over him. In spite of this, Kiyotaka soon changed his mind and considered Kei as an efficient and valuable pawn after saving her, but in truth, her usefulness or not is a secondary concern for him as all that's important to him is that she remained to be his.

Despite this view of her, he appears to genuinely care for her as he protected her by violently attacking Kakeru and defeated him with ease through sheer strength and intense fear for threatening her. His actions surprised Kei as she watched him easily take down C-Class. She was shaken by his true abilities but hugged him as she was relieved that he came to her aid as he mentioned his promise to protect her.

In volume 11.5, Kei sees Kiyotaka and Hiyori Shiina going on a date and becomes jealous. She is also jealous that Kiyotaka has the same hobby as Hiyori.

In the epilogue of volume 11.5, Kiyotaka declares his love for her and she accepts.
