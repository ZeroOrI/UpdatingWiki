Volume 4.5 Chapter 6

```
“It’s so hot today.”
How many times had I said that this summer? Still, it really was hot, no way around it. Even if saying so out loud made you feel hotter, you couldn’t stop yourself.
Just thinking the words didn’t help. Cicadas were probably the only creatures who preferred this sweltering heat. 
Heat aside, I’d gotten caught up in yet another unusual incident. If the other guys knew about this situation, they probably wouldn’t be happy with me at all.
It was a very nasty problem. Well, let’s start from the beginning. A tree-lined path a short distance from the dormitory led to the school. 
If you went off that path, you’d find a rest area. That’s where I was. It was a popular spot to sit down and chat. 
There were several benches and vending machines, the view was great, and many students frequented it in the early spring.
The heat made this a rare off-season period for the rest area. It was completely deserted, which turned it into a perfect spot for a clandestine meeting. 
“Sorry to have kept you waiting.”
As I sat on the bench, Karuizawa Kei walked toward me. She shaded her eyes from the blinding sunlight with a hand and looked at the sky.
“So hot,” she muttered.
Apparently, we were of one mind on the subject. Karuizawa’s long ponytail bobbed as she sat down next to me. 
She wore an unusually casual outfit: jeans and a simple shirt. Even so, the outfit looked coordinated and stylish.
I supposed girls had to prioritize fashion no matter how hot it was, which had to be tough. 
“I know you’re busy right now. Sorry for dragging you out like this,” I said.
“Are you being sarcastic? I played around too much this summer. I don’t have any points to spend, so I’ve just been hanging out in my room.”
“Do you have plans tomorrow?” I asked.
“I can’t really do anything without money. I’ll probably be sleeping.” 
It sounded like Karuizawa really was indulging herself this summer. 
“You should get a lot of points next month, though. I mean, after the last test.” 
During the exam on the cruise ship, Karuizawa—who’d been the VIP —had worked together with me. We managed to keep her identity secret until the test ended. 
Because of that, Karuizawa would receive 500,000 points as a reward come September.
“Yeah, I guess. I’ve picked out the clothes and accessories and stuff I want to get. But is it really okay to use all the points like that? Isn’t it better to save some?” 
“You can hold yourself back?” I asked, teasing her a little.
She puffed out her cheeks and glared at me. 
“Well, it’s not that simple. When I have points, they seem to last less than a week,” she muttered. 
Karuizawa mimed counting all the things she wanted on her fingers. She was out of fingers in no time. Just how many things did she plan to get anyway? 
“But, like, even I know how important private points are. The school system’s really weird, right? You get, like, this ridiculously huge amount of points during special exams and stuff. Everyone else is wondering about that, too,” she observed.
The regular student body was finally starting to suspect that something was up, apparently. I supposed that was natural. 
If you suddenly received a large sum of money, you’d question the school’s motives. 
You’d consider the possibility that private points weren’t just meant for use on one’s private desires. 
“That’s true. Some students might get as many as 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 points,” I said. 
“Yeah. Is it really okay to give high schoolers that much money? It’s definitely not normal.” 
The points were sort of necessary for us to “survive” at school, which was probably why Karuizawa was unsure how best to use them. 
For example, if you made a blunder that could result in your expulsion, you could make the problem go away with enough private points.
Having a few million points on hand as insurance probably was a good idea.
“There’s no reason to think about it too much. Looking too far ahead can drive you insane. If you retain ten to twenty percent of your monthly points, that should be enough,” I said. 
You had to maintain a balance between your wants and needs. For Karuizawa, who’d always been a shopaholic, curbing her desires was hard. 
Besides, if a former spendthrift suddenly became miserly, students in our class might get suspicious.
I didn’t want anyone to connect her change in circumstances to me.
“I want to ask you for a favor,” I said.
“What, you’re not even going to apologize first for calling me out here on such a hot day?”
“Want this?” 
I handed her a bottle of tea I hadn’t drunk from yet. She hesitated, then reluctantly accepted it.
“It’s a little warm,” she muttered. 
“That’s the weather’s fault. Nothing I can do.”
Some places nearby had recorded temperatures of forty degrees Celsius or higher. Just thinking the number made me feel hot.
Karuizawa struggled to uncap her drink.
“Hmph. Guess I got a loser.” 
“A loser? You don’t usually get prizes in tea bottle caps.” 
“That’s not funny, you know. I’m talking about how hard this is to open,” she grumbled. 
Well, it had been a poor joke. I reached over, took the drink, twisted the cap, and returned it.
“Thanks.” 
After what’d happened on the boat, the distance between Karuizawa and I had diminished. 
Before summer vacation, it would’ve been impossible for us to have this kind of conversation. She probably still didn’t trust me, but she showed no sign of that. 
Karuizawa really understood self-control. To protect herself and her status, she could adapt to any environment. 
“Tomorrow’s the last day of summer vacation. One of my friends invited me to make some fun summer memories.” 
“What do you mean, summer memories? We don’t have fireworks or a festival or anything like that here, do we?” asked Karuizawa. 
“The school has a big pool, right? It’s normally reserved for the swim club. Did you know that the restriction was lifted for today?”
That pool was even bigger than the one we used during swim class. For the last three days of summer vacation, it was open for communal use. 
When a huge crowd of students flooded the pool on the first day, the school put additional restrictions in place.
Students could only use the pool once during those last three days. Apparently, the second day was really busy, too.
“Ah. Now that you mention it, though, I’m not that interested in swimming,” muttered Karuizawa.
She always skipped swim class by claiming she didn’t feel well. Even though it was difficult to cut class due to the point system, 
the school couldn’t really question a student’s poor physical condition, especially not woman-specific problems. 
There were girls other than Karuizawa who refused to participate, probably for a variety of reasons. 
They might feel ill, not want other people to know they couldn’t swim well, or even hate swimming in the first place.
Maybe they didn’t want to show that much skin around boys. And so on. However, Karuizawa’s circumstances were different. 
A while ago, Karuizawa had been viciously bullied by her classmates. As a result, she had a terrible scar on her side. If someone saw it, it would definitely cause a stir.
“Do you like swimming?” I asked her.
“Hmm. Well, I don’t hate it, I guess. I haven’t gone swimming for years now, so I’ve probably forgotten how.” Karuizawa drank her tea and stared ahead as she replied.
I could tell that wasn’t how she really felt. 
“So, what, the guys want to make memories at the pool? You’re obviously just planning to be perverts.”
I couldn’t deny that, actually. That was probably exactly their reasoning. 
“So, what does this have to do with me?” asked Karuizawa.
“Before I answer that, let me ask you one thing. Does the school really not know that you were bullied before?”
“Huh?”
Karuizawa looked puzzled for a moment, then turned to glare at me. Her polite façade was gone. I returned her stare.
“You know I don’t want to talk about that, right?” she growled.
“I’m not reopening old wounds for no reason. I’m asking because it’s relevant,” I replied.
“But…” 
This had to be a serious topic for Karuizawa. She seemed to come to a decision.
“All right. I’m sure you must have a reason for this.” 
She tried to swallow her anxieties. 
“I definitely don’t think they know the truth about me being bullied. They might know about my leave of absence from school, or how many days off I took during junior high,
but they probably think those were due to me being sick or skipping class, you know? Or they might just think I’m stupid. That’s probably why they put me in Class D.”
Karuizawa sounded self-deprecating, but she was likely right. The school must’ve had a poor impression of her bad attendance record and low grades.
“Even if the school investigates the matter, they probably won’t find any evidence of the bullying,” she added. 
“You realize that the world is magnificently rotten, don’t you?”
“Yeah,”
Karuizawa muttered. 
“I suffered for many years. I asked my teachers and classmates for help, but that only made it worse. There was no escape.” 
Human nature included a strong tendency to fall into vicious cycles. Bullying was deeply rooted in the human psyche. 
There was no simple solution to it. If a victim pushed back, that might only result in them being attacked more fiercely the next time.
“No matter how often they beat me up, the school ignored the bullying, and wouldn’t do anything. They gave the bullies light warnings, at most.
Of course, it got worse, you know?”
Even if a school acknowledged bullying, they usually wanted to deal with it in secret, so as not to risk damaging their reputation. 
There were schools that would stubbornly refuse to admit the truth even after a bullied student killed themselves, leaving behind a note. 
Worse, death might bring no salvation. The bullied student might be insulted even after they died. 
People could mock them, or share their story on social media for entertainment. What a terrifying era it was, when you could be bullied even after death.
“The school, the people who bullied me, even myself… No one admitted the truth. My friends spouted the same lies. 
That was the only way they could answer, no matter how unjust it was.” 
Karuizawa spoke almost as if she were talking about someone else. In truth, this school had probably investigated her case thoroughly.
Had theyconcluded that she was an airhead, didn’t take school seriously, and cut class? If everyone believed that to be true, then the real truth wouldn’t matter.
It would be buried forever under all the lies.
“But I’m grateful to the people who bullied me, and the school that covered it up,” Karuizawa added.
“No one here knows about my past. That’s why I was able to become a new me. I couldn’t have done that if everyone here had heard of the bullying.” 
She’d turned her situation around by obtaining the exceptionally popular Hirata’s support and protection. 
“Karuizawa, I think you deserve praise, but I should tell you something first. From now on, you’re forbidden to do anything that supports bullying others.” 
“Huh? Are you saying that I’m bullying someone?” 
“It’s one thing to be headstrong, but you’ve been going after Sakura. She clearly isn’t the kind of girl who’d bully you. 
Even if you’re doing it to prevent yourself from becoming a victim, stop.”
Despite Karuizawa’s past suffering, there were things I couldn’t tolerate.
“Sakura-san, huh? You want me to help her because she’s so attached to you?” 
“Do I need a reason? You should understand how it feels to be bullied.” 
“My social status is my lifeline. It’s not something I’m ready to just discard. I do feel sorry for Sakura-san, but the weak exist as prey for the strong.
Especially those pretending to be strong, like me.” She was resolute.
“I’m asking for Sakura’s sake. She’s helped me quite a few times, after all.” 
“Hmph. You openly admit it,” Karuizawa huffed.
There was no dissatisfaction or discontent in her eyes. Only wariness.
“You’re not convincing, but…fine. I’ll be careful from now on. Okay?”
“Being reasonable is helpful. Besides, Hirata’s already established your current popularity. You shouldn’t be in any danger.” 
“I suppose you’re right. Maybe I’ve been overdoing it a little,” Karuizawa replied softly.
“But, if my position does appear to be in danger, then—” 
“When that happens, I’ll back you. If necessary, I’ll bring in Hirata and even Chabashira-sensei to eliminate your enemies. That’s a promise.” 
“Hmm. Okay then. Deal.”
Karuizawa never struck me as the sort of person who’d resort to violence or intimidation in the first place. 
She could pretend all she liked, but she was just playing that part to protect herself.
People who’d been bullied for years usually couldn’t socialize easily, but she overcame that trauma. 
“I wonder why?” she muttered.
“What?”
“It’s just that I don’t really like bringing up my past. I thought I’d never tell anyone about it. But I ended up telling you, and it felt so surprisingly
fine that it’s kind of odd, you know?” 
Apparently even Karuizawa didn’t know why she’d told me about the bullying. I wasn’t sure of the reason, either.
“Can I ask you something? Is the way you’re acting now the real you?” She sounded somewhat guarded.
Karuizawa was the only person in our class who’d seen both my sides. I crossed my arms and racked my brain for how to respond. 
“I’m always like this, I guess.” 
“You’re completely different, though.” 
Well, strictly speaking, this wasn’t really me. However, it wasn’t the same as faking a personality.
“I want to ask you something. What would you say is the specific difference between me right now, and the usual me?” 
“Usually, you’re this gloomy guy. You don’t talk at all. But now, you’re assertive. You’re being direct. Those traits are polar opposites.
The way you talk is different, too. What’s your deal, anyway?” 
“What do you mean? Don’t people simply act differently depending on who they’re with? Don’t you do the same thing?” 
That was probably the best possible rebuttal, although it didn’t fit exactly. The truth was that it felt like I’d just been born as an individual. 
When I enrolled in this school, I wasn’t fully formed. I was like liquid, or moldable clay. 
Developing into a full person took time, and I had yet to completely understand how to interact, or the correct way to express myself.
“Anyway, I plan on just being my usual self,” I said.
“You don’t sound like anything like your usual self,” Karuizawa replied. 
She narrowed her eyes and pursed her lips.
“Let’s get back to the topic at hand. You can keep an eye on me from now on, and determine what kind of person I am.”
“I kinda get the feeling you’re dodging the question. Well, all right. Let’s go back to talking about the school. What’s up with it?”
“Tomorrow, four of us guys—me, Ike, Yamauchi, and Sudou—are planning to go out, along with Horikita, Sakura, and Kushida.” 
“Talk about a bizarre combination. I can’t imagine Horikita-san and Sakura-san hanging out with those guys. 
I guess they’re both friendly with you, but the other three are just going to end up ogling them, right? They have my sincerest condolences.”
“I want you to join us,” I said.
“Huh?! Are you serious?!” Karuizawa shouted.
She had no connection to the group. If anything, there was tension between her and them. “
You can put on your swimsuit at the dorm, wear your clothes over it, and come along. It’ll probably be unpleasant, but if you return to the dorm dressed the same way,
everything should be fine,” I said.
“No, no. That’s not the problem. I really, really don’t want to do this.”
“I sympathize, but you basically can’t refuse, can you?” 
“Wow. You’re the worst.” 
“My decision’s final. You’ll do as instructed.” 
I pushed a handwritten note toward her, adding,
“I’ve shown you some consideration.”
“What the hell? You’re using up my whole day, aren’t you? And it’s the last day of summer, too!”
“You said you planned to spend the day sleeping, right?” I countered. 
“I want you to join us at the pool. But I’m not telling you to participate.”
Karuizawa read my note closely. 
“Wait, what’s the difference between ‘join’ and ‘participate’?” she asked.
I explained in detail why I’d called her. Karuizawa heard me out, then cradled her head in her hands. 
“What’s the matter?” I asked her.
“Got a headache?” 
“Of course my head hurts! It hurts because you… No, forget it. It’s meaningless. Can’t you just ask Horikita-san? Aren’t you close?”
“I can’t rely on her. She doesn’t know how I operate from the shadows.”
“Huh? Why?” Karuizawa sounded incredulous. 
Her disbelief was to be expected. The correct plan of action would be to evade her question and mislead her, but instead, I decided to take things a step further. 
“This entire time, even back when I contacted you on the ship, I’ve acted entirely on my own. I haven’t spoken with Horikita about this, because I still can’t trust her.”
That was all true; I spoke no lies.
“What? You don’t trust her, even after all the time you’ve spent together? That’s weird.”
“She makes an excellent cover for me, like a magic cloak of invisibility. She’s conspicuous,” I replied.
“So, you’re just using her, then?”
“Not exactly, but in this particular situation, I’d say that’s about it.” 
“Hmm? I don’t get what you’re saying. Seriously, can you knock off the vagueness?” Karuizawa flashed me a smile, though.
“Still, your schemes have been successful so far, huh? I really thought that Horikita-san was the mastermind. Seriously, who are you?” I didn’t respond. 
“Well, whatever. I guess being more trustworthy than Horikita-san is a good thing,” she added. 
That was right. Karuizawa was infinitely superior to Horikita in some ways, although I couldn’t explain that to her.
“So, I just need to carry out your orders?” she asked. 
“Yes. Now that that’s settled, would you come with me for a little while? We need to take care of something in advance.” 
“Well, I don’t exactly have the right to refuse.” 
Karuizawa stood and brushed dirt from her skirt, demonstrating just how quickly she wanted to end this. As for me, I didn’t want to waste any precious time, either.
Together, we made our way toward the pool.

Volume 4.5 Chapter 7 Part 2

```
Horikita glanced briefly at Kushida, but didn’t answer. Meanwhile, Kushida’s attention shifted to someone who’d just entered the locker room.
“Oh, Karuizawa-san? Good morning! You came here to hang out?” asked Ichinose.
“What a coincidence! We’re here to swim, too.” 
Kushida couldn’t hide her surprise. Karuizawa almost never swam during class. 
“Heh.”
With that brief response, Karuizawa and the two girls who entered with her headed toward the lockers all the way in the back of the room.
She touched the grating across the vent, and it came off without much effort. That wasn’t due to her superhuman strength.
Someone had entered the locker room yesterday and carefully unfastened all the screws with a Philips screwdriver. 
“Ugh. They’re seriously doing it. These guys are the lowest of the low —complete perverts,” Karuizawa muttered.
She found the RC car up against the vent opening. Its camera’s gleaming lens captured the girls’ locker room at an excellent angle. 
The light next to the monitor glowed a faint red, which meant the camera was in the middle of recording.
Doing as Ayanokouji had instructed her ahead of time, Karuizawa removed the memory card. She replaced it with a new memory card with no data, and put the car back in the vent. 
“That takes care of that.”
Soon, the RC car would return to its owner. 
“He’s the only one who really…” 
As exasperated as Karuizawa was by the guys’ grossness, her thoughts turned to the only person who acted to stop them from carrying the plan out: Ayanokouji.
If Ayanokouji hadn’t done something, her classmates, and even girls from other classes, would’ve had their naked bodies seen without their knowledge.
Even worse, those images would’ve been saved forever. 
“Kei-chan, is everything okay?” 
Sonada, Karuizawa’s classmate, spoke behind her. Ishikura, the third girl, also looked at Karuizawa with an uneasy expression. 
“Ah, yeah. Thanks. I’m good now.”
Karuizawa had used her friends to shield herself from view as she bent down to the vent, just like the guys had done in the other locker room. 
She’d even procured the keys to all the nearby lockers beforehand, so people would see them marked as full, and not use them. 
Now, Karuizawa calmly and carefully returned those keys one by one, taking care not to look too nervous. She didn’t explain what she was doing to her friends. 
They were people who obediently followed instructions without requiring explanations. They were not strong-willed, and they feared being ostracized.
Karuizawa kept such people around on purpose. After she finished changing, and confirmed that no other Class D students were around, Karuizawa thanked the girls she was with.
“I have a little business to take care of later. Will you two be here?” “Ah, yeah. We were thinking of swimming. Right?”

Volume 4.5 Chapter 6 Part 7

```
When it was almost closing time, Ichinose proposed that we head back before the crowds got worse. We all agreed. 
While everyone got changed, I slipped away and waited for my visitor by the pool. 
“Ah, I’m so drained,” I muttered.
Soon Karuizawa appeared, slapping my back as she walked up behind me. 
“Good work. How’d it go?” I asked. 
“It’s just like you said. Honestly repulsive,” she replied. 
“Come on, don’t say that. It’s just youth run amok, right?”
Karuizawa gestured as though she was going to vomit, then scanned her surroundings. 
“How was it? Being at the pool, I mean,” I asked. 
“Whatever. I don’t feel much of anything, but…” 
Karuizawa looked around once more, as if worried about prying eyes. 
“Even though it’s fake, I’m still supposed to be going out with Hirata-kun. If I’m seen alone with you, weird rumors might spring up.”
“Really? Well, maybe they would if I were a pretty boy like Hirata. Sadly, I’m completely lacking in hotness. At best, people will think you’re part of our group,” I told her.
This was an innocuous place to be alone with a girl. It would have been a different story at night, on a secluded park bench, but not here. 
Hirata, Karuizawa’s fake boyfriend, was nowhere to be seen. He was probably busy with club activities.
I didn’t know much about the soccer club’s schedule, but he seemed like an active guy.
“We were allowed to wear rash guards today. You saw them, right?” I asked. 
“Well, yeah. But are you really okay with spending money on a rash guard? They’re pretty expensive.”
“It was a necessary expense.”
Karuizawa held out her hand, and I grabbed it. I felt something hard against my palm.
“What are you planning, anyway?” asked Karuizawa. 
“What do you mean?”
“Why are you different from the others? You could just sit back and enjoy the show,” she said.
Ah, so we were discussing what I held in my hand. 
“It could have ended up fracturing the class. I want to avoid that.” 
That was why I’d called Karuizawa to meet me, although getting her to enjoy the pool had been another of my goals. 
“Did you invite anyone else?” 
“I’m alone. I was with two others, but I told them to go off on their own and have fun.”
“A wise decision.” 
I started walking slowly along the side of the pool. Karuizawa trailed me. 
“Are you aiming for Class A, then?” she asked. 
“You’re not interested?” 
“Hmm, I dunno. I do want points, and I’d be happy to get a job anywhere, but…”
She kicked the air, hands in her pockets.
“I don’t really feel like duking it out with those Class C students, I guess.” 
Karuizawa was referring to a specific group of Class C girls.
Even though I’d managed to contain things to a degree, Karuizawa couldn’t face the girls directly without triggering the past trauma of them bullying her. 
Until that mental prison released her, Karuizawa could never demonstrate her true talents.
“I want to talk to you about something. Just you,” I said.
“What is it?” 
“I don’t know what our next test will be, but I was thinking about preparing a certain trick.” 
“A trick?” 
As we walked, blending into all the hustle and bustle, we discussed extremely important things. Things I hadn’t even talked to Horikita about. 
“To have someone expelled.” 
“Huh?” 
Karuizawa stopped dead in her tracks, as though she didn’t understand what I meant. When I continued walking, she hurriedly chased after me. 
“W-wait a minute. What do you mean?!” 
“Exactly what I said. I’m going to have a first-year student expelled. The ideal candidates would be those three girls who know about your past. If we can’t get to them, then perhaps someone else. If that doesn’t work, then—”
I began.
“Th-then what?” 
“Probably some unnecessary human being from Class D.”
“You do understand what you’re saying, don’t you? Getting someone expelled isn’t that easy,” Karuizawa replied.
“You don’t think so? That’s not really true. I actually have the option available right now.” 
Fingers wrapped tight around the object Karuizawa had handed me, I drew her attention to my hand. 
“Wait, don’t tell me. Is that what it’s for?” she asked, incredulous. “Depending on the situation, I could get someone expelled in a single stroke. Right?” 
“B-but wait. Why are you talking about this? You went all out trying to save Sudou-kun earlier, right?”
It was true that I’d rescued Sudou from the threat of expulsion. However, that was before I was forced to commit to reaching Class A.
As Horikita once said, I had to prepare for the eventuality of cutting off people who dragged us down. 
“Even though you saved Sudou-kun, you’re going to kick him out?” Karuizawa asked.
“Oh no. I have no intention of getting rid of Sudou. His physical skill will be quite valuable to Class D,” I replied.
There weren’t many other students in the whole school with comparable abilities, including Kouenji. 
“But what will happen to our class points if someone is expelled?” wondered Karuizawa apprehensively.
“The best option would be to expel someone from another class, of course.” 
However, if a student from our class was expelled, fear would motivate the survivors to struggle mightily. That wouldn’t be the worst thing. 
“You’re awful, you know that?” said Karuizawa.
“Surely you already realized that about me?”
“I guess.”
I’d threatened Karuizawa. My actions had verged on assault. I couldn’t imagine that she considered me a good person.
“How about consulting Hirata-kun?” she asked. 
“I have concerns about that. Hirata still isn’t someone I can fully trust,” I replied.
“Huh?”
“You know about his past?” 
“Oh, yeah. He told me about it when I told him what happened to me. His friend tried to commit suicide by jumping, right?” 
That was right. Hirata had told me that he still carried that regret around with him, which was probably true.
“Do you really believe that his friend’s suicide attempt turned him into a student who’d be placed in Class D?” I asked. 
“Huh?”
“That can’t be the only reason for the school to assign a highly intelligent and immensely popular student to our class. Don’t you agree?” 
Placement in Class D would have been understandable if Hirata had poor attendance, or low grades like Karuizawa, but that didn’t appear to be the case. 
“Wait. You asked about my past because…”
“I wanted to understand Hirata’s situation. Past trauma doesn’t equate to getting placed in Class D,” I replied.
Confirming things with Karuizawa had convinced me that she was someone I could trust. However, Hirata wouldn’t be easy to deal with. 
I’d need to discreetly figure out whether he was telling the truth or lying.
“You keep trying to gather information by poking and prodding, but you’re not telling me anything,” grumbled Karuizawa.
“Hmm?”
“You’re not normal, like, at all. Something definitely happened to you.” 
“Nothing really happened to me,” I replied. 
“That’s a lie.”
Nothing had happened. I wasn’t bullied in the past like Karuizawa, and I hadn’t had a beloved friend attempt suicide like Hirata, either.
“I can tell just from your eyes. You look like you could kill someone without hesitation.”
“Nothing that dramatic took place in my past.” 
There really was nothing. So little had happened to me that I had nothing to talk about. My life was a blank slate. Karuizawa’s eyes locked onto me.
She probably couldn’t help but wonder what her future contained. Holding onto that fear could most certainly prove useful.
However, she’d asked me what I intended to do. Almost as if answering that question, I clenched my fist tighter. As I did so, I heard the plastic in my hand bend and crack. 
“H-hey!” 
I walked to the garbage bin and tossed away the bits of plastic.
“I won’t expel anyone from Class D. It’s about time for me to get back to the group. Thanks for today,” I said.
“Okay…”
“Let’s head back, then.” 
As the pool closed, students started to flood into the locker rooms. Which group you belonged to seemed to determine when you headed back. 
There were groups that left before closing, like Ichinose’s, groups that left just when the closing call came, and groups that remained in the pool until the very last second.
I wondered which groups would make it back the fastest. We quietly watched the other students as they walked away. 
After some time, the area was deserted, except for some lifeguards. 
“You’re still not heading back?” I asked. 
“You already know the answer, so why even ask?”
Karuizawa lightly patted the spot on her rash guard right above her scar. She looked desperate. Still, it wasn’t like she could go home without changing.
She had to wait until she was the last person in the locker room. 
“It would be fine if you just wore a school-issued swimsuit, right?” I asked. 
No one would notice her scar. 
“Ugh, swim with one of those on? No way. They’re too lame. I already hate having to wear one during lessons.”
Apparently, the world of girls was crueler than I thought. Even an unfashionable bathing suit could demote you on the social ladder.
“Do you like swimming?” 
“Huh? Well, I don’t hate it,” she said.
“How about taking a little swim now? There aren’t any students around. The only people here are lifeguards, and they look busy cleaning up.”
Karuizawa pondered the idea. After all, it was better than the crowded locker rooms. 
“I’m okay,” she muttered. 
“Come on.”
“No, I won’t ‘come on.’ I told you, I don’t want to.”
“Even if someone sees you, you’ll be fine, as long as you’re wearing the school swimsuit.” 
“That’s not the problem. Why do I have to show you my swimsuit?” she huffed.
So, that was what held her back. In that case, I thought perhaps I should use a slightly more aggressive method.
“That’s an order.” 
Karuizawa glared at me. 
“You seriously are the worst. I absolutely hate you.” She scowled. 
“You decide whether to obey me or not. So, what’ll it be?” 
“I understand,” she replied.
Karuizawa reluctantly did as instructed, pouting with dissatisfaction. She removed her rash guard and left it on a chair. I inspected her in her swimsuit.
Karuizawa stood with her back to me, not turning around.
“Maybe this will be the only thing I can wear swimming for the rest of my life,” she muttered.
She was still terrified that her scar would draw people’s attention. I closed the distance between us and grabbed her arm.
“Wh-what are you—?!” 
I shoved Karuizawa into the pool.
Splash! 
She crashed into the water. When a lifeguard heard the noise, she shouted at us with a megaphone. 
“We’re closed! Please leave right now!” 
“Pwah! What’d you do that for?!” Karuizawa shouted. 
As she peeked angrily out from the water, I offered her my hand.
“Did you have fun?” I asked.
“Being pushed in isn’t exactly fun, you know.” 
Karuizawa took hold of my outstretched hand. Then, without warning, she pulled me into the water. I didn’t resist at all, taking care not to crash into her when I fell. 
The resulting splash, even bigger than before, would certainly anger the lifeguards. Karuizawa laughed as they rushed over to us.
When I tried to surface, she held my head down and pushed me deeper underwater.
Even though the situation was childish, seeing Karuizawa enjoy something ended up making it worthwhile.

Volume 4.5 Kei's SS

“Hey, what’s so funny?”

During the evening, Karuizawa said this while looking at the students who were returning to the changing rooms. She was sitting near the window, her hair drenched, water droplets falling from her hair to the ground.

The reason of this was because, a moment ago, I pushed Karuizawa, who was unwilling to swim in the pool, to the water.

She looked as if she was going to vomit at any moment while looking at the students with contempt.

“You... Forget about it, it’s not really anything, but if I really have to say it, you are also part of those people.”

It could be said that Karuizawa had got the most female friends in the class. Weekdays and weekends she probably spent the time meeting with lots of friends to play everywhere.

“Only people like me who can’t be in the limelight can look down at groups of people like those”

“Hey, although it might be like this…”

Karuizawa somewhat showed understanding, but she probably couldn’t accept my words, so she kept speaking.

“Although I believe everybody thinks in the same way, they would have a negative attitude towards things that are outside of their scope of understanding. That is, what’s called their inner perception, maybe? Isn’t there some moments where you believe “this is absolutely the truth”, right?

Karuizawa voiced this speech, not because she wanted to show off. Having seen her usual attitude, I had never thought that she would make such a reliable speech, so I couldn’t help but gasp in admiration to these words.

“What, did I say something strange”?

“No… It’s just that I have similar thoughts.”

It’s just that I never thought Karuizawa and I had these identical thoughts. With her outer appearance and her actions being so different, her inner being was very reliable. I guess that currently nobody apart from Hirata knows about this.

I did not look at her, but I raised a topic – that included her scar.

“I actually think I have a method to solve that”

Wearing a swimsuit does not imply showing the abdomen. Although it would require to pay close attention while changing clothes, that doesn’t mean it couldn’t be done. In the event someone were to tease Karuizawa, the circumstances would not be the same, but I don’t think anybody would pick a quarrel with her while changing clothes.

“It’s not only about this issue. I just simply dislike swimming in a public place. And my body would be completely exposed if I wore a swimsuit”

“So is it because you don’t have self-confidence?”

My statement was not malicious, but she probably interpreted them as if they were full of malice, so she returned the question to me.

“Don’t you know? Nowadays even grade schoolers don’t wear school swimsuits.”

“Really?”

“Because right now you can wear any type of swimsuit”

In other words, just as bloomers disappeared with the time, school swimsuits were also removed.

“After all, even the trendy top I’m wearing right now is permitted.”

However, this also showed that there were lots of suspicious elements.

“…is this because you wanted to see my swimsuit?”

“Don’t get the wrong idea. I was just thinking whether or not you had not played to your heart’s content”

After being told that by her, I suddenly realized I talked too much.

“Hmpf”

Karuizawa pretended not to hear this and shifted her line of sight to me.

“I feel that, although I’m not very sure, but perhaps it’s a good thing that I’m able to communicate with you right now”

She seemed to be whispering to herself.

“Not only Hirata-kun, right now I still have friends around me. But I have been hiding my real self all the time, that’s why, although I am also perplexed, but how should I put it, I feel at easy. If it was like usual, I would have never done this, but my heart wouldn’t be able to refrain from thinking that it wouldn’t be a bad thing to try to swim a bit, it’s really unimaginable.”

Even so, Karuizawa still didn’t intend to stand up, this was because there was a clear-cut difference between the “things she could do” and the “things she couldn’t do”.

Karuizawa was shouldering a psychological wound and a physical scar, none of them could be easily cured.

This might be me overestimating my capabilities, but if my existence can bring healing to this person, then as a person, this is something worth being happy.
