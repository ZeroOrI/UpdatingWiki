Kei's debut was at first volume:
Volume 1 Chapter 6:
```
Based on Ike’s conversation, it sounded like Hirata was dating
Karuizawa. Watching Karuizawa from afar, I saw that she was gazing
lovingly at him from across the room. 
```

2nd Volume 3 Chapter
``` 
If Kushida lived by the softness of her heart, then Karuizawa lived by the strength of her will. Perhaps it was because of Kushida and Karuizawa’s influence that many of the girls started to express their support. 
...
Hirata, Kushida, and Karuizawa had attracted the rest of our class’s admiration.

Volume 1 Chapter 6 Part 3:
```
It was true that Karuizawa certainly was one of those gyaru types with tanned skin and everything, but she was plenty cute.

4th Volume Chapter 2:
```
No, no. Karuizawa definitely seemed like that kind of girl. Even though she pretended to be nice in front of Hirata, she was domineering with other ladies. I wondered if Hirata had categorized her as not being “that type of girl.”

“Ha ha ha! Don’t make me laugh. He’s your only friend, isn’t he? There’s absolutely no way I can trust such a gloomy, lecherous wallflower,” Karuizawa said.

Kiyo and Kei's study session

Volume 5 Chapter 3
```
“Hey, excuse me? I object to this, too. You’re okay with sentencing the unathletic students to lose, like Shinohara said? You think we can all come together in a situation like this?”
Karuizawa spoke up, supporting Shinohara.
She glared at Horikita. 
“I’ve said as much. Do you understand my logic?” 
“No. I don’t get it at all. Hey, what do you think, Kushida-san?” asked Karuizawa.
Kushida had been strangely quiet during the meeting. She seemed slightly surprised, but spoke after a moment.
“It’s tough. I’ve been thinking about how both sides feel. Like Horikita-san, I want us to succeed as a
class. But, just like Shinohara-san said, everyone should have a chance to win. If there were some kind of middle-ground solution, that would be ideal. A strategy we could all get behind.” 
Once Kushida was done, there were a lot of noises of assent. 
Horikita seemed to have anticipated this idea.
“Of course. I have a compromise that should be agreeable to both sides. Students who place at the top, and don’t need to boost their test scores, will use the private points they win to boost the test scores of students who place at the bottom. The entire class will share in the gains and losses of private points from the festival. I trust there will be no complaints?” asked Horikita.
So, in exchange for lowering our chances of victory across the board, we less-athletic students would also offset the risks in case we were defeated.
The bottom ten students across each grade level would still be in trouble, though.
“Oh, yeah, that’d be fine,” said Sudou with a disdainful snort, as if he were calling the opposition pathetic whiners.
“But that’s just for points. We’re still losing out on chances to win the big prize. What does everyone think about that?” 
Karuizawa wasn’t letting this go. She looked over to her group of girls. 
“If Karuizawa-san objects, then so do I, I guess.” 
One after another, the girls followed her lead.
“You’re objecting just because she objected? That’s completely illogical. This is an exam. It’s only natural that we focus on a winning strategy. The other class definitely isn’t weighed down by morons like you,”grumbled Horikita. 
“You just don’t get it, do you, Horikita-san? I hate this plan, and the other girls hate it, too. So, you need to take our opinions into account. We have to make these competitions fair,” said Karuizawa.
“Calm down, both of you,” said Hirata.
“If we can’t agree, then we’ve got to have a majority vote.” 
This had probably been inevitable.
“I think we should vote,” continued Hirata. 
“If Yousuke-kun says so, then I agree,” said Karuizawa. 
“Fine. This isn’t the time to fight amongst ourselves. At any rate, I’ve offered my opinion. I hope you’ll all make the right decision,” said Horikita.
She sat down in frustration and glared at me.
“Ayanokouji-kun, can’t you tell Karuizawa-san to shut up?” she huffed. 
“Uh, no. There’s no way I could do that,” I said. 
“You’ve been talking to her lately, though. Haven’t you? Isn’t that why she’s getting carried away?”
“No. Karuizawa’s always been like that,” I replied.
“That’s certainly true,” Horikita muttered.
She couldn’t hide her irritation with Karuizawa, whose opinion lacked logic, or with the girls who let someone else lead them around.
“Now then,” said Hirata.
“We have Horikita’s proposal, which focuses on ability, and Karuizawa-san’s, which prioritizes the individual. How about we decide which plan we prefer by a show of hands? If anyone finds choosing a side difficult, they can abstain.”
Horikita wanted to win, while Karuizawa wanted everyone to feel valued. The class’s future would depend on whether people used their heads or their hearts.
Of course, I myself had zero interest in the outcome.
“All right. All those in favor of Horikita-san’s plan?” “Yeah. I agree with Horikita’s plan, of course,” said Sudou.
“It’s about winning. When winners win, we all win. Ain’t that a good thing?” Sudou raised his hand.
Those who had no confidence whatsoever in their athletic abilities, like Yukimura and Sakura, followed his lead.
But the more capable students, along with Karuizawa’s group, didn’t raise their hands. 
“Sixteen votes, then. Thank you. You can put your hands down.”
“Wait a minute, Ayanokouji-kun. Don’t tell me you agree with Karuizawa-san’s plan?” said Horikita, who realized that I hadn’t raised my hand.
“Relax. It’s my policy to abstain from voting.” 
“In that case, you could just have voted for my plan,” she growled. 
“Your plan isn’t necessarily right, is it?” I asked.
“I can’t understand you. Giving the class the best-possible chance of winning will ultimately result in netting a lot of private points. Even if we only won a few matches here and there, the points would be significant. If you say that’s wrong, perhaps you can give me a clear reason why?” 
“I didn’t say you were wrong. I’m just saying it’s not the only answer,” I replied.

The students used as sacrificial lambs, sent out to be destroyed by strong opponents, would finish the sports festival without earning any points at all. 
Horikita did understand that much, at least. But she also thought it was a necessary sacrifice in order to win.
“The other students aren’t all as ambitious as you,” I told her.
“All right. Next, we have Karuizawa-san’s plan. Anyone in favor of this plan, to win when we need to and have fun when we want to, please raise your hand,” said Hirata.
Along with Karuizawa’s group, other students began raising their hands.
“And the results of the majority vote are…sixteen votes for Horikitasan’s plan, and thirteen votes for Karuizawa-san’s. 
It’s safe to say that everyone else abstained from voting?”

```
Had Karuizawa instead gone to someone weak, like me or the Professor, for support, Manabe and the others could have hounded her.
Karuizawa had definitely made the correct decision.
