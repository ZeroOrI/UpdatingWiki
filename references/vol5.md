Volume 5 Chapter 2

```
“The students’ surnames were the key to figuring out the VIPs’ identities. They were assigned in the order of the animals of the zodiac.”
We sat at a table all the way in the back of the crowded café, Pallet.
Summer vacation had just ended, and I was seated with a bizarre crew that included Hirata, Karuizawa, and Horikita. 
We were trying to review the special exam that’d been held on the cruise ship during our vacation, comparing notes on the test that divided us up
into groups based on the twelve zodiac signs. 
“The rabbit is fourth in the zodiac. If you put the names of the students in the rabbit group in alphabetical order, it would be Ayanokoujikun, Ichinose-san, Ibuki-san, and then Karuizawa-san,” said Horikita. 
“I see. In that case, yeah, I’d be fourth. That’s why I was chosen as VIP,” said Karuizawa. She seemed impressed. 
At first glance, you’d have thought that the two girls sitting with me were completely incompatible, but Hirata’s presence made the discomfort between them mysteriously disappear. 
“But isn’t that really, really simple? I mean, practically anyone could figure it out. Like, the fifth person in the dragon group was Kushida-san, so she was the VIP, right?” asked Karuizawa. 
She put a straw in her milk carton and sipped. 
“It was that simple. However, figuring that out in the middle of an exam wasn’t so easy.
With only three VIPs in your own class, you wouldn’t have had enough solid data to determine the system behind the selection,” explained Horikita.
If we’d known the names of the three VIPs in another class, we might have seen the pattern.
However, even if we’d had a theory about how the VIPs were chosen, it would have been risky. If we were off, we could have taken considerable damage. 
Of course, on the other hand, if we’d bet the farm and won, we might’ve turned everything around in a single stroke.
“I’m worried about Class C, though. I think Ryuuen-kun figured it all out in the middle of the test,” said Hirata. 
He was probably right. 
“If that’s true, then why did he mess up?” asked Karuizawa.
“I wondered about that, too. If he understood the rules, he should have discovered all the VIPs,” said Hirata.
Horikita offered a different perspective on the matter.
“Though it appears that Ryuuen-kun rules Class C alone, perhaps that isn’t actually true. More than a handful of people are probably deeply dissatisfied with his dictatorship.”
“Yes. A rebellious student must’ve tossed out the wrong answer in direct defiance of Ryuuen-kun.”
Horikita and Hirata were onto something, but we still couldn’t be sure. If there was a traitor, Ryuuen would’ve searched for them relentlessly.
Even if that person had deleted the email, Ryuuen would probably have gone so far as to check people’s private points.
“What do you think, Ayanokouji-kun?” asked Horikita. 
Hirata and Karuizawa looked to me at the same time. I broke out coughing, discomfited by the force of their combined attention. 
“Dunno. I honestly don’t have a clue,” I lied.
Horikita and Hirata looked away, losing interest all at once. Only Karuizawa still stared at me. I met her gaze, and she diverted her eyes.
“In any case, our first priority is to cement this relationship. I’m glad we’re discussing this, Horikita-san and Ayanokouji-kun,” said Hirata. 
Horikita had never cooperated with Hirata before. However, her attitude had finally begun to change after the two special exams.
Being driven into a corner made her start to realize the truth: that she couldn’t do this alone. 
“Well, we don’t really have a choice. The zodiac exam was a special case. If we assume that future exams may have similar elements, though, then a certain degree of cooperation will be necessary,” replied Horikita.
“That said, you evaded Ryuuen-kun’s clutches quite well.” 
The last part was aimed at Karuizawa, who’d been my group’s VIP, and managed to get through the exam without being discovered. Class D had been well rewarded for that victory. 
“Well, I guess. I do have a surprisingly good poker face. Right, Yousuke-kun?” asked Karuizawa.
She hugged Hirata’s arm and looked at him with upturned eyes. You’d never have thought that their relationship had been strained, though whether that was genuine or an act
didn’t interest me. Wait a minute—Yousuke? When had Karuizawa suddenly started calling Hirata by his first name?
I kind of wanted to call him by his first name, too, but it was impossible. Hirata and Karuizawa had forged a new relationship out of their complicated situation, which most
likely made them closer friends. Hirata returned Karuizawa’s smile, then turned to Horikita. 
“I actually have a proposal. Want to hear it?” Hirata asked.
Horikita gave no response—her way of telling him to speak.
“First, to bring our class together, I’d like to rope in Kushida-san as an ally. I think she’ll complement our group well and add qualities that the four of us lack.
She could potentially unite a lot of the boys, starting with Ike-kun and Yamauchi-kun.”
“Unnecessary,” replied Horikita.
“I won’t deny the fact that she has certain skills, but we can do anything she can on our own. That’s why I selected you and Karuizawa-san.
With your combined talents, we can solve any problem that faces us…unless you plan to be uncooperative, like a certain someone.” 
She side-eyed me. How rude. 
“It’s certainly true that Ayanokouji might not follow our lead,” added Karuizawa.
She and Horikita nodded, though Hirata did not. 
“Look, you’re mistaken if you think I’m the uncooperative one. I’m the guy most likely to quietly go along with a group. I’m exactly the sort of person you can control. I have no presence,” I said. 
“Those who claim that they have no presence usually cast long shadows,” replied Horikita.
“Okay. So, are you someone with no presence?” I asked. 
“Me? There’s no way I could have no presence. How dare you? Do you take me for a fool?” she demanded. 
“Uh…sorry.” 
The whole conversation was devolving into some half-baked comedy sketch, although Horikita didn’t appear to be joking around. 
You could never quite tell when she was playing, but I thought she was definitely serious.

Vol 5 Chapter 3

```
“Enough already, Shinohara. If we lose because of you, will you take
responsibility? Huh?” Sudou, normally the worst in terms of academic
ability, now beamed with hope and a sense of leadership.
“That’s…ugh.”
“Honestly, what a pain,” Horikita muttered in my direction. “It’s like
you’re not even paying attention. Instead of messing around on your phone,
how about you try coming up with ways for us to win?”
“Well, if I just leave it to you and Hirata, you’ll sort out our
problems, right?” I replied. Still, I turned my phone off and placed it in my
pocket. The discussion appeared to be over—or so I thought.
“Hey, excuse me? I object to this, too. You’re okay with sentencing
the unathletic students to lose, like Shinohara said? You think we can all
come together in a situation like this?” Karuizawa spoke up, supporting
Shinohara. She glared at Horikita.
“I’ve said as much. Do you understand my logic?”
“No. I don’t get it at all. Hey, what do you think, Kushida-san?”
asked Karuizawa.
Kushida had been strangely quiet during the meeting. She seemed
slightly surprised, but spoke after a moment. “It’s tough. I’ve been thinking
about how both sides feel. Like Horikita-san, I want us to succeed as a
class. But, just like Shinohara-san said, everyone should have a chance to
win. If there were some kind of middle-ground solution, that would be
ideal. A strategy we could all get behind.”
Once Kushida was done, there were a lot of noises of assent. Horikita
seemed to have anticipated this idea.
“Of course. I have a compromise that should be agreeable to both
sides. Students who place at the top, and don’t need to boost their test
scores, will use the private points they win to boost the test scores of
students who place at the bottom. The entire class will share in the gains
and losses of private points from the festival. I trust there will be no
complaints?” asked Horikita.
So, in exchange for lowering our chances of victory across the board,
we less-athletic students would also offset the risks in case we were
defeated. The bottom ten students across each grade level would still be in
trouble, though.
“Oh, yeah, that’d be fine,” said Sudou with a disdainful snort, as if he
were calling the opposition pathetic whiners.
“But that’s just for points. We’re still losing out on chances to win the
big prize. What does everyone think about that?” Karuizawa wasn’t letting
this go. She looked over to her group of girls.
“If Karuizawa-san objects, then so do I, I guess.” One after another,
the girls followed her lead.
“You’re objecting just because she objected? That’s completely
illogical. This is an exam. It’s only natural that we focus on a winning
strategy. The other class definitely isn’t weighed down by morons like
you,” grumbled Horikita.
“You just don’t get it, do you, Horikita-san? I hate this plan, and the
other girls hate it, too. So, you need to take our opinions into account. We
have to make these competitions fair,” said Karuizawa.
“Calm down, both of you,” said Hirata. “If we can’t agree, then
we’ve got to have a majority vote.”
This had probably been inevitable.
“I think we should vote,” continued Hirata.
“If Yousuke-kun says so, then I agree,” said Karuizawa.
“Fine. This isn’t the time to fight amongst ourselves. At any rate, I’ve
offered my opinion. I hope you’ll all make the right decision,” said
Horikita.
She sat down in frustration and glared at me. “Ayanokouji-kun, can’t
you tell Karuizawa-san to shut up?” she huffed.
“Uh, no. There’s no way I could do that,” I said.
“You’ve been talking to her lately, though. Haven’t you? Isn’t that
why she’s getting carried away?”
“No. Karuizawa’s always been like that,” I replied.
“That’s certainly true,” Horikita muttered. She couldn’t hide her
irritation with Karuizawa, whose opinion lacked logic, or with the girls who
let someone else lead them around.
“Now then,” said Hirata. “We have Horikita’s proposal, which
focuses on ability, and Karuizawa-san’s, which prioritizes the individual.
How about we decide which plan we prefer by a show of hands? If anyone
finds choosing a side difficult, they can abstain.”
Horikita wanted to win, while Karuizawa wanted everyone to feel
valued. The class’s future would depend on whether people used their heads
or their hearts. Of course, I myself had zero interest in the outcome.
“All right. All those in favor of Horikita-san’s plan?”
“Yeah. I agree with Horikita’s plan, of course,” said Sudou. “It’s
about winning. When winners win, we all win. Ain’t that a good thing?”
Sudou raised his hand. Those who had no confidence whatsoever in
their athletic abilities, like Yukimura and Sakura, followed his lead. But the
more capable students, along with Karuizawa’s group, didn’t raise their
hands.
“Sixteen votes, then. Thank you. You can put your hands down.”
“Wait a minute, Ayanokouji-kun. Don’t tell me you agree with
Karuizawa-san’s plan?” said Horikita, who realized that I hadn’t raised my
hand.
“Relax. It’s my policy to abstain from voting.”
“In that case, you could just have voted for my plan,” she growled.
“Your plan isn’t necessarily right, is it?” I asked.
“I can’t understand you. Giving the class the best-possible chance of
winning will ultimately result in netting a lot of private points. Even if we
only won a few matches here and there, the points would be significant. If
you say that’s wrong, perhaps you can give me a clear reason why?”
“I didn’t say you were wrong. I’m just saying it’s not the only
answer,” I replied.
The students used as sacrificial lambs, sent out to be destroyed by
strong opponents, would finish the sports festival without earning any
points at all. Horikita did understand that much, at least. But she also
thought it was a necessary sacrifice in order to win.
“The other students aren’t all as ambitious as you,” I told her.
“All right. Next, we have Karuizawa-san’s plan. Anyone in favor of
this plan, to win when we need to and have fun when we want to, please
raise your hand,” said Hirata.
Along with Karuizawa’s group, other students began raising their
hands.
“And the results of the majority vote are…sixteen votes for Horikitasan’s plan, and thirteen votes for Karuizawa-san’s. It’s safe to say that
everyone else abstained from voting?”
Karuizawa hadn’t won votes with a well-articulated plan. Rather, she
relied on her installed support base to do what it could. Apparently, most
students believed that Horikita’s plan was realistic and efficient.
Class D’s strategy would be, not to participate as individuals, but to
win as a class.
“…………” Since Karuizawa had approved a majority vote, she
couldn’t complain now.
“Then it’s decided,” said Horikita. “Now, Hirata-kun, I’ll leave the
rest to you.”
I didn’t think we’d necessarily made a bad choice. Unathletic
students wouldn’t be taking the initiative in the first place. Inevitably, those
asked to fill the recommended-participant positions would be jocks like
Sudou and Hirata.
“So, regarding the number of participants for recommendedparticipant events…” Hirata continued.
“I’ll participate in every competition. If anyone’s got something to
say about that, then they can meet me outside, and we’ll talk face-to-face,”
Sudou declared. He had one card, and he was playing it all the way.
Furthermore, he apparently intended to force anyone who complained to
surrender. Too aggressive, but the strategy seemed effective, since no
dissatisfied grumbling could be heard.
“I will also compete in as many events as possible.” As expected,
Horikita volunteered herself. Karuizawa’s face stiffened slightly. The girls
around her quietly whispered in one another’s ears, and I wondered if they
were badmouthing Horikita.

After class, I had some free time. I decided to contact a certain person before heading back to the dorm. As I rose, I exchanged looks with Karuizawa. She must not have understood my intentions, because she left the classroom with two of her friends. Giving up, I grabbed my bag and started to head back to my dorm alone, like always. I left roughly one minute after Karuizawa. Upon descending the stairs, however, I found her seemingly waiting for me, standing alone by the main entrance. “Wait,” she said. “I thought you left.” “I thought you had something you wanted to talk about, so I waited. Was I wrong?” I couldn’t help my surprise. “I do, I suppose.” “Well, I have something to talk to you about, too. Mind hearing me out?” “Go ahead.” “That message you sent me… What are your real intentions?” She showed me her phone. The text displayed on the screen read, “No matter what, object to Horikita’s plan. Then ask Kushida for her opinion.” I’d instructed Karuizawa to do that in the middle of class. “When it comes to improvising, you’re quite fast on your feet. You did very well,” I told her. “Really? You know, I actually agreed with Horikita-san’s plan. I don’t understand why you had me call on Kushida-san, either. What are you playing at?” she asked. “If you worry over each and every thing I do, you’ll never know peace. Besides, I’m under no compunction to answer your questions. Understand?” I asked. “So, I should just do as I’m told, like a loyal dog, and never ask why. Got it.” “Exactly.” Karuizawa didn’t seem pleased, but didn’t object further. “One more thing. You didn’t raise your hand. Which choice did you think was right?”
she asked. “They could both be right, I guess. Everything depends on the individual, anyway.” “That’s not an answer.” “I have a policy of ignoring questions trapped in the limited ‘eitheror’ binary,” I said. “Huh? I don’t get you. What do you even want, anyway? Are you just trying to wreak havoc on everyone? Or are you seriously thinking about getting from Class D to Class A?” “Horikita seems to believe I’m fighting for the latter, at the very least.” Karuizawa glared, as if to say, That’s not what I asked. “I wasn’t asking what Horikita-san thinks. I want you to knock off the space-cadet act and just tell me what you’re after.” “I see. Well, I’m not personally interested in reaching Class A. It’s just that I think it might benefit me if our class rises to the top,” I said. “Wait, what does that mean? What’s the difference?” I decided not to mention my bargain with Chabashira-sensei. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you. So, I’m taking several precautions to make you believe down the line. One of our classmates will betray us during this sports festival. They’ll leak internal information from our class,” I said. “Wait, what?! Are you being serious right now?!” Karuizawa was incredulous. “When the time comes, you’ll understand…what I’m seeing, what I can see,” I told her. “Huh?! Tell me what’s going on!” “I can’t right now. But when the time comes, I will. Right now, you should go. We’re drawing too much attention here.” “You don’t need to tell me that. If I were seen hanging out with a weirdo like you, my social cred would plummet. But…even if someone does betray the class, we’ll be okay. Right?” she asked. “Yes. I’ve prepared.” Looking dissatisfied, Karuizawa turned and left. I watched her walk away and sighed to myself. Class D’s strategy was in motion, as was my own personal plan.
Now then, I wonder what Class A has in mind? Considering Katsuragi’s personality, their strategy would be solid. But Sakayanagi would be good for the White Team, of course, and also for Class D. Imagine a hypothetical situation with two people and only one lifesaving apparatus—let’s say a life jacket, meaning that only one of the two people can live. One person is able-bodied, and one disabled. If the ablebodied person chose to save themselves, they could probably take the life jacket by force with relative ease, due to the other person’s disability. The world is cruel. A crisis tends to bring out the worst in us. That said, just because Sakayanagi wasn’t physically active didn’t mean she was harmless. “Even so…” Karuizawa was better at reading people than I’d imagined, probably because of her past. Satisfied with the completion of some rather unexpected business, I decided to head back.

“We haven’t decided on any tactic, is that okay?”

Having already arranged our cavalry battle position, Shinohara, who was beneath me, muttered these words right before the competition started.

“I don’t think there’s any problem. In a sports festival, you only have to take it seriously to some extent.”

“Eh? Ah, ok. But Karuizawa-san, if you thing this is okay for you---“

“Do I look like that type of motivated person?”

“It’s because you opposed Horikita-san’s proposal when the class was deciding about the competitions by recommendation, so I was under the impression that…”

“Ah…”

That wasn’t my idea. I acted following that guy’s orders. Honestly, Horikita-san’s proposal about distributing the participants according to their abilities not only made things easier, but also it was a stratagem that ensured the success of the class. It could even be said that this was looking after the students who were unwilling to try hard. It seems that I was ordered by that guy to do some unnecessary things, causing me to be looked with different eyes by other people.

“In short, let’s do it at random”

“Roger--”

After saying these words, the cavalry battle began. There shouldn’t be anything extraordinary in the school’s cavalry battle –these thoughts were immediately subverted.

The reason being Class C quietly advancing forward and unceasingly attacking Class D. The vanguard was Ibuki-san. She was that existence that thrown my class into chaos.

Ibuki-san led the cavalry to do a surprise attack to Horikita-san.

“Shinohara, go! Support Horikita-san!

“Eh? Ro-roger!”

Even though she was surprised at me suddenly issuing an order, the horse still dashed forward.

“Although I’m not interested in winning, I don’t want to lose like this…!”

I didn’t know whether these words were said to Shinohara, or myself.

In brief, Horikita-san was targeted and leaving her alone would cause a terrible situation.

“Stop! I’m sorry, but I can’t let you go past here!”

The one who came to block us was Ichinose from Class B. Even though I haven’t really interacted with her that much, I thought she was difficult to handle.

“What do we do, Karuizawa-san…?”

Shinohara-san, who was holding the center position of the horse, sook for my instructions.

“We have no choice but to go forward, even though I don’t really want to do that”

My physical capabilities are not very outstanding and I don’t want to do troublesome things. But—

Right now that guy is probably looking here. Although I don’t know why, but I just don’t want that guy see me suffering a crushing defeat. That existence that knows about the darkness of my heart. That existence that said he will protect me.

Fortunately, Ichinose’s movements are not as difficult to handle as I thought. I can barely deal with her. While dodging her, I issued a specific instruction to Shinohara-san, to keep a suitable distance.

“Why am I trying so hard…?”

This time I was talking to myself. Everybody was trying hard so nobody heard my whisper.

During the summer vacation, I was also involved together with that guy. The same thing happened with this sports festival, making me help him with things I failed to understand. I just kept helping him, not knowing what he was doing or what he wanted to do.

Normally this would be unpleasant. But I don’t know why I never like this.

That’s certainly because the harm I’m really worried about deep down has not appeared.

The girls from Class C who wanted to look for problems with me haven’t come back again. Is this merely a coincidence? No, absolutely not. That guy… Ayanokouji-kun, did something for me.

Just because he let me have this premonition, that I’m obeying him.

“!?”

I barely evaded Ichinose’s hand.

“Ah, really, this doesn’t look like me!”

The image of Horikita’s horse falling entered my field of view. Ah, we are going to lose.

But the only thing I can do right now is to focus on the adversary in front of me.

I was gradually changing.

I was gradually receiving change.

But the unexpected thing was that I don’t dislike it.

Right now I’m unable to confront the gradually changing myself.

Even after we returned to the tent, Sudou didn’t calm down. I kept my distance to let him cool off. Karuizawa called to Hirata and me. “Isn’t this bad news, Kiyotaka?” she asked. “What is? Wait. Why’d you use my first name?” I asked. “Why? Well, I call Yousuke-kun by his first name, so I thought I’d try using yours,” she replied. Then why had she dropped the honorific in my case? Was she implying that I was lower than Hirata? “At any rate, I want to discuss Horikita-san. Hasn’t she been struggling for a while now? Even during the cavalry battle, she was in really rough shape,” said Karuizawa. “Yeah,” I replied. Horikita was in a bad way, and not just in the team contests. Her rankings had fallen greatly across every event. The reason was clear: the fall during the obstacle course had injured her right leg. We normally would’ve suggested that she withdraw, but if she did, then Class D would be penalized. “I don’t really think I can blame her, though. Her opponents were just too much,” said Karuizawa.
True. Horikita had gone up against difficult opponents each and every time. If she kept facing off against students who were the best in their respective clubs… This was far too much to be mere coincidence. “It’s no use. She’s being targeted,” I said. “Targeted? So, it’s not accidental that she keeps facing all these incredible students?” “It’s the only reason I can think of. You know how athletic she is, too, right?” I replied. There was just one person who might order such a thing: Ryuuen Kakeru. Only he would prioritize humiliating Horikita over leading Class C to victory. “He’s definitely harassing her,” I said. “Someone is harassing Horikita? But why?” asked Karuizawa. “It’s not just Horikita. They seem to know all our strategies for the competitions, and the composition of all our teams. We’re being played like a fiddle.” “So, information about our class got leaked? Someone sent out our participation table?” “Yes. They handed all that information over to Ryuuen,” I replied. “That’s… Well, actually, Horikita was always up against Yajima-san and Kinoshita-san. Does this have anything to do with the traitor you were talking about?” asked Karuizawa. I gave her a small nod. “But, wait, how did you find out? Honestly, it wouldn’t surprise me if you just came out and said you were the traitor or something… I mean, that’s not what you’re saying, right?” “Unfortunately, no,” I replied. Putting aside the question of “who” for now, the crucial bit was that the traitor had leaked our class’s information. Ryuuen knew everything, and he’d done two things in response. First, he’d intentionally set up his weaker students against our more talented athletes, like Sudou and Hirata. Then he put his more athletic students up against our hopelessly unathletic competitors, like Ike and Yamauchi. That way, he could snag even more wins by beating them. Second, Ryuuen was targeting Horikita. However, that really had no direct bearing on leading his class to victory. He wanted to crush Horikita
for the sole purpose of destroying her. And, in truth, Horikita had been crushed. She’d completely lost face. These strategies revealed much about Ryuuen Kakeru. He could have switched around his players to keep us from figuring out his plans, but he wanted us to know. He wanted to rile us up. “So, you’re not going to help her?” asked Karuizawa. “How would I do that?” “Well…I don’t know,” she replied. “The participation table is already set in stone. There’s nothing I can do.” “You’re saying that Class D is going to lose?” “Guess so.” “Isn’t there anything we can do?” “You should ask Hirata about that.” “That’s…well, that’s true, I guess. But…I thought if I talked to you, you’d think of something.” The sports festival was playing out right in the open. Thus, there weren’t many chances for subterfuge, like there had been on the island. It would be a Herculean task to pull the wool over the entire school’s eyes. Our two options were fighting fair, and taking opponents like Ichinose and Katsuragi head-on, or using cowardly tactics while taking dangerous risks. Ryuuen was only committing these acts of foul play after careful rehearsal and lots of practice. Nearly all these results had been decided before the sports festival even started. “What do you think of Horikita?” “What? I don’t like her. She’s all high and mighty and full of herself,” Karuizawa replied. “But you’re worried about her.” “Well…maybe I kinda understand what she’s dealing with.” Karuizawa knew the bitterness and agony that came of being targeted by a bully. In that way, she could empathize with Horikita. “Class D is in last place right now, yeah? Is there no way for us to win?” asked Karuizawa. “Don’t worry. Everything so far has been going according to plan,” I told her. “I knew it. You did think of something. Then how do we win this thing?”
“Win? I have no intention of winning. What’s important right now is to do nothing,” I replied. “Huh?” Karuizawa’s mouth hung open in shock. I was trying to think up a way out of this incessant questioning when I heard a very angry roar.

Volume 5 Chapter 6 Part 10

```
Our group now contained ten people, including both guys and girls. After finding a suitable spot, we started eating. As people finished up, Hirata and Karuizawa approached me. Smartly done; with a bunch of classmates around, it wouldn’t look odd or unnatural for such a trio to form. “Looks like Ryuuen-kun’s making his move, as expected,” said Hirata. “So, who’s the traitor? You know, don’t you, Yousuke-kun?” asked Karuizawa. Hirata just gently shook his head. “There are several things I don’t understand.” “Well, I can’t say who the traitor is,” I told them. “Huh? Why?” asked Karuizawa. “Because, right now, we’d only throw the class into even more turmoil by identifying them. We need to deal with the traitor quietly and calmly,” I told them. “Okay. I won’t hound you. But why did you submit the participation table to the school when you knew there was a traitor? Couldn’t we have adjusted the table ourselves? We could have flipped the script on Class C,” said Hirata. “Probably,” I said. In truth, I’d wanted Horikita to discover the spy and deal with it appropriately. “Wait. The traitor might be someone nearby, right? It might even be someone among us right now. Can we afford to take it this easy?” asked Karuizawa. She scanned her surroundings, suspecting everyone at the gathering. Traitors were certainly troublesome, but depending on the circumstances, it could be more convenient just to leave them alone. Besides, even if we’d used Hirata’s strategy, it probably wouldn’t have worked against Ryuuen. Right now, it would be difficult to make Hirata and Karuizawa understand why, so I lied instead. “I’ve taken stock of the traitor’s moral fiber,” I said. “Moral fiber?” “I think they want to reform without being cornered.” Hirata stared at me intently. “And this is all on Horikita’s orders, right, Ayanokouji-kun?” If Hirata was already suspicious of me, then he would soon no longer trust me. Even so, I needed him to believe me right now, if only for
appearances’ sake. “Yeah. Everything is going according to Horikita’s plan.” Hirata didn’t question me any further. He seemed convinced. “So, where is Horikita-san? What’s she doing?” asked Karuizawa. “Something only she can do. At least, I hope that’s what she’s doing,” I said. “Wait. Are you talking about Sudou-kun?” Hirata glanced around, noticing that Horikita and Sudou were nowhere in sight. “Without Sudou, it won’t be easy for us to win the second half of the sports festival, right?” I asked. “Yeah. We’re relying on Sudou-kun,” said Hirata. Karuizawa looked a little dissatisfied by the prospect, but she understood. The sports festival’s outcome now depended on Horikita. If my words hadn’t reached her, it was game over.

Volume 5 Chapter 9 Part 1

```
“You were super fast.” Karuizawa averted her eyes as she spoke
to me.
“Wasn’t it just that my opponent was slow?” “No, no. No way! Can you really say that after seeing everyone’s reactions?” “Jokes aside, I still didn’t beat the student council president in the end, did I?” “Well, there wasn’t really anything you could’ve done about that. The runner in front of you fell down, after all.” True. That runner ended up blocking my path. I’d avoided hitting him, but the slight delay was a significant loss, and Horikita’s older brother had pulled ahead. I didn’t know what would’ve happened without that accident, but I didn’t really care. At the very least, I was certain that I’d probably gathered the whole school’s attention during the final competition. Many students looked at me with puzzled expressions. “Ayanokouji! You really are super fast, dude. Whoa! Have you been holding back until now?!” As he came running up, Sudou slapped me on the back with all his might. It really hurt. “Running’s pretty much my only specialty, but I overdid it. That’s the power of being fired up, huh?” I replied. “That still doesn’t explain it, though. That speed. You liar.” Horikita walked up to me, still dragging her leg slightly. “You guys, this isn’t how you should treat a soldier who fought with everything he had,” I whined. Horikita jabbed my abdomen. “Ow, that hurts!” Karuizawa moved out of the way, so as not to get between Horikita and I. Sakura was also looking at me from afar, but because there was a big crowd around me at this point, she didn’t get close.
