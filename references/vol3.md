“This view is incredible! I’m honestly super moved right now!” A group of girls led by Karuizawa came out from the ship’s cabin. Karuizawa pointed out to the expansive ocean, wearing a radiant smile.

Volume 3 Chapter 6
```

“Um… I don’t think that A-Ayanokouji-kun would do such a thing…” 
I’d thought that all the girls doubted me and no one would back me, but someone rather unexpected spoke up for me. Sakura, cowering behind everyone with her back arched, fidgeted bashfully while she spoke out in my favor. I couldn’t have imagined a girl who disliked being noticed more than anything doing such a bold thing.
“Huh? What do you mean? Why would you say that?” answered Karuizawa, seemingly upset about Sakura speaking out.
The sheepish, nervous Sakura was an easy target for such a popular girl. Sakura was definitely easier to confront than Horikita. In an instant, Karuizawa changed her target, lashing out at Sakura with her words as if sinking her teeth into prey. 
“Huh? Why? How do you know that? How do you know Ayanokoujikun isn’t the culprit?”
“Well…that’s because…he isn’t that kind of person.” Sakura was backed into a corner, and barely managed to squeak out her fearful answer.
“Huh? I don’t understand what you mean. That’s not an answer.” Karuizawa folded her arms and laughed mockingly at Sakura.
“Oh? Could it be that Sakura-san likes someone plain and invisible like Ayanokoujikun?” Rather than saying it contemptuously, Karuizawa said it as though it were reasonable to assume.
It would’ve been fine if Sakura had just shrugged off such remarks, but she took them on.
“Y-you’re wrong!” Sakura stumbled back in a panic, her face completely red.
“Whoa! That’s such an obvious reaction. It’s like what an elementary-schooler would do!” 
The other girls joined Karuizawa in laughing out loud.
“That’s…! W-well… Ah!” “Heh, isn’t that a good thing, though? You like him, and no one else does, right? Hey, will you confess to him here? I’ll even help you out!”
“Ah!”
Sakura, unable to bear this attention any longer, ran off into the forest. Kushida chased after her, wisely judging it d

Volume 3 Chapter 6

```
Unlike the boys’ tent, which was Spartan-like in its lack of comfort, the girls’ tent was completely different.
It was spacious, with a floor mat on the ground so that they wouldn’t have to sleep on the hard earth. 
There were several pillows inflated with air. On top of that was a battery-powered cordless fan.
“The tent on the other side has the exact same things in it, too. A total of twelve points.” 
“I thought the girls were putting up with the heat unusually well. So this is how you’re getting through it.” They hadn’t sacrificed anything from the very start. They’d simply bought whatever they needed.
“Karuizawa-san and the others asked for these.” Apparently, they’d secretly indulged themselves quite well.

“I only found out after they’d already ordered everything. It’s difficult to do anything when the rules say anyone may buy an item and spend points.”
Just like how Kouenji had withdrawn so early in the test. 
“Karuizawa-san reported this to Hirata-kun, so he definitely knew about it. But you didn’t know, nor did he inform anyone else. I think he absolutely should have shared this information.” Horikita had her arms crossed.
She did have a point, but I doubted Hirata had stayed quiet out of malice. Maybe he’d just wanted to avoid unnecessary confusion? If Karuizawa had reported properly to Hirata, then the amount could have been evaluated.
“I understand what you mean, but there’s nothing I can really say about it. We can’t get spent points back, and there aren’t many days left before the test ends. Karuizawa and the others probably won’t spend any more points,” I said.
