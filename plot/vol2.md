### New Version

**When Chabashira announced to the class that Sudō had gotten in a fight a few days earlier with C-Class students and that the two sides had given conflicting reports of what happened. Many of the students from Class 1-D began to voice their frustration for Sudō and his attitude. Although students voiceed their dissatisfaction, Yōsuke Hirata and Kei Karuizawa backed him up and the atmosphere in the class changed into one motivated to prove Sudō innocent.** [19](../references/vol2.md)

**After school, two groups of students were formed in order to search for the potential witness to the event, with Hirata and Karuizawa leading one group and Kushida leading the other.** [20](../references/vol2.md)
