**Gathered in the Pallet cafe at the end of their summer vacation, Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, Kei Karuizawa, Yōsuke Hirata, and Suzune Horikita talk about the results of the zodiac special exam that took place on the cruise ship. The students’ surnames were the key to figuring out the VIPs’ identities. They were assigned in the order of the animals of the zodiac. Hirata also brings up the subject of how they can further unify their class going forward. The rabbit is fourth in the zodiac. If you put the names of the students in the rabbit group in alphabetical order, it would be Ayanokouji, Ichinose, Ibuki, and then Kei. Because of that Kei became VIP.**

**At first glance, everyone'd have thought that the two girls sitting here were completely incompatible, but Hirata’s presence made the discomfort between them mysteriously disappear.**

**Group was interested how Ryuuen figured it all out in middle of the test. Horikita and Hirata asked opinion of Kiyotaka, but he replied that he didn't know. While two of them lost thier interest in him Karuizawa still stared at him until their eyes met.**

**During their converstation Kiyotaka noticed that Karuizawa had suddenly started calling Hirata by his first name. Nobody would ever have thought that their relationship had been strained, because how close they looked.**

**Hirata also brought up the subject of how they could further unify their class going forward. He suggested to rope in Kushida as an ally. Horikita said that was unnecessary, because they two were enough until they didn't plan to be uncooperative like Kiyotaka. Kei agreed with her on that matter.** [56](../references/vol5.md)

**During one of Class 1-D homerooms, Sae Chabashira announced that the first month of the second semester beginning in September will include an increase of physical education classes in order to prepare for the upcoming Sports Festival.**

**Students who will get high places in competitions also get private points while people, who will constantly lose, get a penalty on the next test.  While Class D discussed the order of participation and who will be chosen for Recommendation only events, they divided into two groups: the first one was for selection based on that everyone wants and the second based on student's abilities.**

**Horikita suggested pairing up the stronger athletes with the weaker ones to increase chances, but Karuizawa went against her because it would be sentencing non-sportive people to lose.**

**During their arguments, Karuizawa asked the opinion of Kushida about this. She didn't know the answer, but she wanted to come to a compromise.**

**But even when Horikita suggested a compromise, Karuizawa still wanted to let other students get a chance to win a big prize. Other students joined her side despite that her arguments were weaker, due to her influence in the class.**

**To calm down the situation, Hirata said they should vote. Horikita won, in the end, this vote, but the difference between them was only 3. Since Karuizawa had approved a majority vote, she could not complain now.**

**After classes ended, Kei and Ayanokouji exchanged looks. When she noticed him, she went out of the classroom with two of her friend.**

**Karuizawa waited at the entrance alone because she understood that Ayanokouji wanted to talk with her. He was surprised by her thoroughness.**

**Before he could say that he wanted, Karuizawa questioned him why did he order to go against Horikita's plan and ask of Kushida's opinion. She agreed with selection based on abilities, but because she got the email, she needed to act.**

**Ayanokouji complimented Karuizawa's improvisation, but he said that he did not plan to answer. This reply angered her because he treated her like a loyal dog.**

**There was one more thing that interested her. She was curious about his opinion about the selection.  Ayanokouji said that he hadn't raised his hand because both plans could be right. She wasn't satisfied with this answer.**

**Ayanokouji decided to end this conversation by revealing that there will be traitor during this sportive festival who would spy on their class for other team. So it didn't matter which plan they will choose. He didn't plan to give her proof but said that Karuizawa would understand this during competitions. This only gave even more questions but Ayanokouji said that they should stop because somebody could spot them. She didn't wish that somebody saw them together and decided to go.**

**Karuizawa was good at reading people probably because of her past.**

**It was time for the first-year girl's cavalry battle. Karuizawa had been chosen as one of the horsemen from Class 1-D.  Shinohara, who was part of the same unit, worried that they didn't have any strategies before the start of the competition.   She thought that Karuizawa was motivated based on her opposition to Horikita's proposal.**

**It seemed that order caused Karuizawa to look different in the eyes of other students.**

**Ibuki led the cavalry to make a surprise attack on Horikita. When Karuizawa understood that, she gave a command to Shinohara to help Horikita. Even though she was surprised by this sudden order, she still dashed forward.**

**Before they could reach Horikita, Ichinose's unit stopped them. Shinohara was surprised by this encounter and sook for Karuizawa's instructions.**

**Ichinose went for a direct attack, but her movements weren’t sharp. Karuizawa managed to react well and launch a counterattack.**
  
**Even if her physical capabilities weren't very outstanding and she didn't want to do troublesome things, she couldn't let Ayanokouji see her defeat because his existence should protect her.**

**It would be completely normal if she hated him for things that Ayanokouji forced her to do, but she wasn't like that. She got a feeling that he did something because girls from Class 1-C didn't try to approach her anymore.**

**After a first-year males cavalry battle, Karuizawa called to Hirata and Ayanokouji. Ayanokouji was surprised when she started to call him by the first name without any honorifics.**
 
**Despite his questions about the reason for this sudden change, she expressed her worries for Horikita.**

**Since she injured her right leg, her ranking had fallen greatly.**

**Ayanokouji said that she was targeted by Class 1-C. All athletic students in her match-up aren't coincidental. He continued and said it's not only Horikita, they knew about all other their strategies. Karuizawa assumed the traitor leaked information. Ayanokouji confirmed it.**

**Karuizawa couldn't understand how he found out that.**

**Karuizawa asked if Ayanokouji had a plan to turn things around, but while he confirmed that everything is going according to his predictions, winning the sports festival wasn't something he intended Class D to do. He suggested her if Karuizawa wanted to fix the situation she should go for Hirata's help then.**

**Even though Karuizawa didn't like Horikita because she acted so arrogant, she was still was worried and wanted to help.**

**They could continue this discussion because their conversation was interrupted by Sudō, whose temper had finally snapped.**

**Lunch break begins. Hirata and Karuizawa joined Ayanokouji for lunch, and the three of them discuss Ryūen's strategy so far, as well as the traitor in their midst.**

**After the race was over, Karuizawa couldn't hide her surprise from Ayanokouji's speed because he could revile with student council president. When other students started approaching them, she tried to move out the way.**
